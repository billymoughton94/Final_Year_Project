An action game with tactical combat and citybuilding. An adventure game that lets you free-roam a vast, procedurally-generated world. A Valley Without Wind defies genre stereotypes. Unlike other procedurally-generated games, you also get a logical progression in difficulty, plus helpful tips and checklists to guide your travels (should you need them). Choose for yourself how to prepare to face the vastly stronger Overlord. Complete a variety of missions to earn new spells, and/or roam the wilds to uncover secret missions and stashes of magical crafting loot. Customize your characters with unique combinations of enchants and spells that change how you move, jump, and fight. Or rescue people and bring them back to your settlement so that they can then be sent on dispatch missions; you don\'t have to carry the burden of your fledgling civilization alone! You choose how to play, and the world adapts around you. Key features: Travel alone or with friends across an ever-expanding world of dangerous creatures, powerful magic, high technology, and mysteries. You have choice. The world of Environ is a procedurally generated sandbox, and lets you go anywhere you see -- including right into the overlord\'s keep at any time. (Good luck with that.) Environ is endless. When you save one continent from an overlord, a larger and more complex continent appears. The game adapts to how you play: as you demonstrate your proficiency, monsters and missions upgrade accordingly. Killed 100 bats? Okay, time for... bats on fire! Crazy amounts of character customization. Combine a multitude of spells, enchants, and equipment to create specialized character builds. Play as a long line of brave adventurers. It\'s not a question of IF your character is going to die, but WHEN. Any character that dies is permanently lost, but you keep all your inventory, enchants, and general progress in the game. Become a community leader. Rescue NPCs for your settlement, construct buildings for them, and improve their skill and mood -- then send them on dispatch missions to help you in return! Be a clever problem-solver. Challenges have more than one solution, each with its own pros and cons. You get to figure things out rather than just jumping through a set of hoops. Difficulty levels give exactly the challenge you want, from casual to hardcore on platforming, combat, and citybuilding independently. All owners of Valley 1 also get the much-improved sequel absolutely free!  Valley 2 is out now, and features a different style of more-focused, non-sandbox play.

You choose how and where to explore via the world map, how to upgrade your character via mage classes, feats, and perks that you unlock, and how to battle the forces of evil every step of the way. Your character is a mage who has infiltrated the inner circle of the evil Demonaica, and you now share the power of immortality that he uses to terrorize the land. Using this power against him, it\'s time to lead an uprising and ultimately bring him and his henchmen back to mortality so that they can be dispatched. Gameplay alternates between two modes that complement each other: brief, tightly-designed platforming segments where your character customization and equipment can be tuned to meet the tactical needs of the current stage; and quick strategic turns on the world map where you order your troops to fight, scavenge, build, recruit, farm, and use special powers.  Demonaica and his armies pursue your forces directly on the world map, while his five henchmen have been sent to recapture you in the platforming segments. Your immortality came at great personal cost, but it makes you the one last hope of saving the world from darkness. Key Features: Platforming and Turn-Based Strategy Coupled Together: Flip back and forth between your own adventure, and the progress of the resistance you\'re in charge of.  Freely adjust difficulty levels for both to tailor the experience to your own personal playstyle.  Both sides of the game can be quite easy or incredibly hard. More Tactile Combat: The physics of movement and attacks have been completely redone from the first title, with more traditional gamepad and keyboard support. Spells have mass and can block each other, leading to many interesting tactical situations in the platforming segments. Vastly Improved Visuals: Fully redone artwork by Heavy Cat Studios, including 125 all-new monsters, 200 spells, and lots more. Focused Gameplay Arc: Unlike the endless sandbox-style first game, this complete re-imagining has a distinct beginning, middle, and end. Procedurally Generated Worlds: Each world is a unique challenge, leading to excellent replay value once you do beat the game! Co-Op Multiplayer: Bring along as many friends as you like on your journey, depending on your connection speed. 2-8 players recommended on most Internet connections; many more on LAN. See Just How Deep An Arcen-style Rabbit-Hole Goes: After dozens of hours you still haven\'t seen it all: 50 mage classes in 5 tiers, 200 spells, 125 enemies, 14 biomes, 100+ types of world map tiles, 64 character customization perks, 100ks of procedural equipment possibilities.

(22, 'Abducted', 'No image available', 'Jul 5, 2017', 'Sunside Games', 'Action,Adventure,Indie,RPG,Early Access', ' Abducted is a 3rd person action-adventure game using the latest Unreal 4 technology.  Created by former Battlefield and Borderlands developer Richard Cowgill, Abducted is truly out of this world. Abducted is a game with focus on a complex storyline, immersive gameplay as well as a mixture of classic adventure game and RPG-lite mechanics.  It spans a wide range of gameplay types and environments, everything from a linear corridor type of experience to open world, non-linear gameplay.  You can expect plot twists, surprises, and an unconventionally told story with deeper, underlying meanings. Abducted draws its inspiration from classic adventure games and modernizes these ideas.  If you like any form of story driven adventure game Abducted is for you. Keep in mind, this is Early Access.  While the game is very far along in development and the whole game is there, several elements are not yet finished.  And bugs do exist, it is not yet ready to be stress tested. Gameplay & Mechanics The Arm One of the most interesting and mysterious things you will do is interact with an alien computer embedded in your arm, which we simply call �The Arm.� Why and how the computer got there is a critical element of the story. The Arm computer is your primary source of guidance and information. In truth, it�s your only friend and ally in an otherwise baffling and inhospitable world. You interact with your Arm computer by having conversations with it. We have developed a directed free-form conversation system that allows for near endless discussions. In Abducted the flow of conversation is player-driven and not predetermined. This is very different from games such as Mass Effect or Star Wars Knights Of the Old Republic where conversions are fixed in their structure. What does this mean for you as the player? It means that you can discover things through conversation in a very dynamic way. You may uncover information about your environment that gives you interesting backstory, unlocks a new ability or upgrade, or even saves your life. However, you are never forced to use The Arm. You can have deep hour long conversations with it or you can ignore it entirely. The Dreamscape The Dreamscape is the realm all around you, think of it as the world of metadata that you can\'t physically see.  But using your Dreamscape ability, you can leave your physical body and explore this realm free-form.  The aliens who made this place, whoever they were, left you all manner of clues and information to be discovered.  By exploring the Dreamscape you can solve puzzles, gain critical information and learn things you otherwise couldn\'t in human form. Manipulate In Abducted the environment can be �manipulated� (moved) by the player. Manipulating objects is a mysterious power that The Arm gives to the player. Some objects in the environment are deadly unless they are restrained from moving. Manipulate can be used to solve puzzles, defensively to create safe areas, or to otherwise save your life.  In some cases it can be used to open new paths and hidden locations. Pulse Your Arm can fire a bolt of energy that will obliterate anything in its path. It is a scary and often unwieldy weapon that if left charging too long has the potential to explode, killing you and anything unlucky enough to be in the vicinity. Pulse and your other abilities will gain upgrades during the course of the story that are narrative-driven.  These upgrades stay with you and open up new areas and possibilities. Shield The alien technology that inhabits your body can generate a close quarters force field that can protect you from incoming attacks.  In some cases the Shield will be the difference between life and death.  Like Pulse, as the story progresses new abilities will unlock allowing you to do things you otherwise didn\'t think were possible. Exploration In Abducted exploration is a mechanic in and of itself. The player has to combine critical thinking and his/her other abilities to successfully explore and travel through the environment without being injured or killed in the process. Sometimes exploration and progression involves run-and-gun intense action where you must use your Shield and Pulse abilities to blast your way through flesh-eating bugs as big as your head. Death in Abducted doesn�t just happen from being eaten. It can also come from all manner of environment hazards. Uncompromising Art We may be indie, but we don�t intend on looking like it. Sunside uses advanced 3D techniques that are typically employed in modern AAA games, but we do this more rapidly and with lower cost than big studios. One example of this is our main heroine of the story. Music and Sound FX Music and sound effects are extremely important to our environment. We have partnered with Voodoo Highway Music to produce all our music and sound for Abducted, and they have already created a large volume of amazing content for us. The result will be a game that is extremely immersive and environmental.'),

From indie Chilean developer ACE Team comes a new side-scrolling action adventure game featuring a complex fighting engine in procedurally generated levels that destines its three warriors to battle for an eternity.  Enter the bold Katrien, the tortured specter Ghost Monk, and the ethereal Pincoya.  Use the characters to perform combos, chaining attacks and releasing a flurry of blows in order to survive what lies beneath.  Your path into the unknown may start out with three fierce warriors, but when you learn to possess your enemies, you can challenge the abyss with their skills and combat abilities.  Each foe is as technically complex as the main warriors, so use all the options available to you and attempt to figure out the infinite abyss. With side-scrolling levels that never play out the same way twice, you\'ll have a fresh experience every game as you face monsters, find life-saving merchants, and uncover treasures. Begin your downward journey into the depths of the unknown. Key Features Deep combat system that takes cues and mechanics from the fighting game genre. All playable characters have an expansive set of basic and special attacks unique to each of them, along with a host of universal mobility options and advanced tecnhiques. Practice your moves and develop new combos in the Training room, where you can select any character you\'ve unlocked in game, including the enemies. Procedurally generated levels ensure no delve into the Abyss is the same. The rooms of the Abyss with their various twists and traps are randomized on every entry. Enemy spawns, equipment and items to be found, special characters to encounter, and more are different each and every time you play. Unlock up to three hero characters to level up, earn skills, and collect equipment, then customize it all to best suit your play style. Leveling up earns skills points to upgrade each hero\'s unique skills a variety of ways, while various weapons and accessories can be equipped to grant them new abilities ranging from freezing opponents to cursing them. Play as any character you encounter in the game�even the bosses. Unleash your hero\'s ultra attack to steal enemies\' souls, allowing you take their form. Discover brand new move sets and character styles as you capture over 30 enemies, each as complex and advanced as the three heroes. Work as a community to defeat the final boss together. When the collective community of Abyss Odyssey players defeats the final boss enough times, his mask breaks to reveal a new identity. Each time this is achieved, new content will be unlocked in game, including new enemies and other dynamics. Beautiful visuals inspired by Art Nouveau, showcasing a story rich in Chilean culture. The flowing lines and beautiful organic styling of Art Nouveau can be seen from the game\'s UI to its character design. Set in late 19th-century Santiago, those characters and the game\'s story also draw heavy inspiration from Chilean folklore and mythology. Play the campaign solo or with a friend in online or local cooperative multiplayer. A second player can drop in or drop out at any time to join you in your journey down the Abyss. Bonus versus mode allows up to 4 players to test their skills against each other. Fight it out in special arenas developed for free-for-all or team-based competitive multiplayer. Use any character you\'ve unlocked in game, hero or enemy, for dozens of characters to choose from. ');

AFF focuses on team-oriented tactical gameplay and objective-based scenarios with a high degree of replayability, featuring: Wide selection of weapons and tools, ground vehicles and spacecraft to fight with. Diverse combat opportunities - assume point to clear a building, hunt with a frigate wolfpack as a lineship captain, issue orders from the bridge of your battleship. Fully operational and pilotable capital ships with playable interiors. Unique combination of spaceship and infantry combat - board spacestations, shipyards and vessels to capture or destroy them from the inside. Dogfighting using space interceptors and bombers, launched from capital ships and stations. Gameplay mechanics designed as a mix of modern elements (customization, loadouts, persistence) and inspirations from classic shooters (frantic, fast-paced firefights). Commander mode for issuing orders to your squadmates and teammates. Full AI support - all scenarios can be played both offline and online identically, supporting up to 64 players or bots filling in for the players if required. Rich science fiction universe setting. Another space game? Well, we\'ve been doing this a long time - AFF has been a rich universe of fiction and art since 2005. We made a Homeworld mod, and kept building from there. Work started on an Unreal Tournament 2004 mod, but was then ported over to UT3 in 2007, culminating in a 3rd place grand prize in 2009\'s MakeSomethingUnreal contest. Angels Fall First as a standalone game is, for us, a mission to enable the player to do as much as possible in a vast environment - whilst still retaining the focussed, fun experience of match based FPS games. Way back in the back-whens, we loved Tie Fighter. A little later on, we loved Battlefield. We waited patiently for the game which would inevitably unite the vast scale and spacefights with the close and personal firefights and thunderous vehicle battles... But it never really appeared. Many games came close, but there was always some part missing. You couldn�t get out of your spaceship, you couldn�t get into your spaceship, you had big spaceships but you couldn�t run around in them, you could run around in your big spaceship but you couldn�t fly it and so on and so forth and gahd damMIT! Where was our spacefight groundfight game? So, we set ourselves to work. AFF exists because it MUST exist. Only in AFF can you spawn in your crew quarters, run to the bay watching the space fight out of the windows, launch a dropship, fight through the defenders to the enemy flagship, breach the hull, run and gun your way to the bridge and SHOOT THE ENEMY CAPTAIN IN THE BACK OF THE NECK. Calm Down! Ok. But it\'s this slightly twitchy passion which has driven us to create such a monster. We grew old making this, and we got grumpy watching everyone else release their cool games or whatever. We\'re from a time when games were about blowing stuff up for points and glory and now FINALLY we want to go out there and share this crazy passion with all of you!'),

It\'s a bit puzzle, a bit resource management, and some tycoon strategy.  There are no build queues, and you are having meaningful interaction with your economy every single turn.  There are no \"other players\" to compete against, but we\'ve instead used a \"time pressure\" type enemy that consumes planets as it spreads across the map - because a fun game needs a challenge component, and we find symmetric AI opponents problematic in other games, so this was the best solution.  Difficulty is fully in your control, and ranges from zero-challenge to something the creators can\'t beat, so you\'ll find your own best settings with experience. Apollo4x has \"4X\" in the title, but this is not an indicator that we\'ve made a \"traditional formula\" title like Master of Orion, or the games that follow that economic and combat model.  Steam has a multitude of games that do, and do it so well that there\'s no point in us making a competitor to them. The Idea What we did is toss out the economic model of exploring a hidden map, having AI opponents that attempt to play the same game as the player (because they generally fail, and obviously cheat) and long build queues where you just hit \"next turn\" 100 times before anything significant happens.  Rather than have you build a navy of spaceships and militarily conquer other simulated players, we made more of a tycoon puzzle economy.  Each planet has three \"exports\" and you put two \"imports\" on them.  Money is made by matching exports on one planet to imports on another, with the limitation of fuel availability, which is dependent on how upgraded each planet is. The Enemy Since we don\'t have simulated players to compete against, we decided on using a \"creeping doom\" style opponent.  The enemy spreads out organically from their homeworld(s) at a pace you determine in the difficulty settings.  You can, and will have to, slow their spread and defend your own planets from this steadily encroaching threat.  Each enemy colony adds +1 army to their homeworld defense, so the player is encouraged to keep the enemy from growing into an impossible strength and speed of expansion by \"pruning\" their colonies.  If your chosen win condition is to cleanse the galaxy of them entirely, you\'ll have to weaken them first through attrition. Combat We went out of the 4X realm and built in a tactical card game inspired in part by some of our favorite tabletop combat games.  Morale, combined arms, and multiple possible tactics for each of the very unique units to choose from every turn.  Four different enemy clans to battle, based on the four horsemen - death, war, pestilence and famine.  Each has an entirely different set of units and tactics and requires a completely different battle plan to beat.  War fights with brute force, while pestilence attacks with morale crushing horror weapons, and death gave up their bodies for machines and now are the unliving reapers.  Currently there is no space combat or fleet building, being instead like Starship Troopers where your troops are \"dropped in\" and just fight the ground war.  This is to keep things simple and not have two different combat systems in a game that\'s primarily a trading puzzle - but if Apollo4X does well, it\'s on the list for whatever sequel we make. Winning Winning the game is accomplished by either economic or military means.  You can kill all the enemy homeworlds.  Alternately, stockpile 300 of each market resource, or upgrade your colonies to produce a cumulative 500 \"stellar network\" points and colonize 20 planets.  Military, economic, or expansion victory is your choice. Game Difficulty Finally, we allowed you maximum choice of difficulty.  Tailor the game to your needs, so you feel challenged but not overwhelmed.  If you think the economy could be more resistive, turn it up.  If you want to not worry about enemy expansion you can weaken them, start them with less colonies, or lower rate of expansion.  Or, if you really like the combat game, set the economy to easy and add all four enemy types to the map at maximum strength -- good luck with that, though.  If you want to go fully casual, we even allow you to turn off economic failure, and have unlimited funds to experiment with.  We, as players ourselves, lose interest in games that are too hard or too easy, so it seemed important to give the player full control of it.  Since most people want to play on \"average\", we\'ll be listening to feedback about which difficulty settings are most popular and adjust the \"average\" levels to those trends down the road a bit. We dared to be different in a genre full of excellent but too similar titles.  If different is what you need, this is it.'),

There were originally 3 core versions of the game available of different hardware - PC, XBox360 and Sony PSM. Sony version is the oldest and smallest version. A critically acclaimed launch title for PSM (Vita). XBox version is the Sony version with extra added levels + enemies + refinements. PC version is the most feature rich and improves on the XBox one with new Weapons + Gradius style Arcade mode + yet further refinements and extra details (with the Steam version being unique in having online leaderboards and achievements).

Brad is constantly playing his axe-lute and generating notes, standing still will cause him to \"jam\" and generate notes even faster.

Our soft-body physics engine simulates every component of a vehicle in real time, resulting in realistic, dynamic behavior. The driving feel is authentic and visceral, and crashes are realistic and violent; yet the physics are accessible enough to drive with a keyboard or gamepad while still being authentic with a full racing wheel with uncompromising realism. Environments and vehicles in BeamNG. drive are hand-crafted with passionate attention to detail. With years of meticulous design, research, and experience, we authentically recreate the feeling and excitement of real world driving. We are a small team from around the world with no obligations to publishers or outside interests. Our users and modding community are our first priority. Help us make BeamNG. drive the ultimate driving experience and discover what an open and uncompromising soft-body vehicle simulator can be. Why is BeamNG. drive the game for you? As an open world vehicle simulator, BeamNG. drive will cover a large array of vehicular disciplines - everything from a delivery mission in a box truck to a high speed rally race or a destruction derby. The vehicle customization and detail will allow you to make your car or truck all your own - fix it up, upgrade it, or strip away body panels to reduce weight. There are a lot of different types of gameplay we want to implement beyond just racing and crashing, such as police chases, stunt challenges, and other specialized minigames. Eventually we would like to have some kind of single player open world career mode, with persistent vehicle ownership and procedurally generated used vehicles to buy and events to run them in. In some ways, BeamNG. drive is about doing anything you want with a car or truck - the stuff other games don\'t let you do. You can go off-roading in a family sedan or hurl a delivery truck around a racing circuit, all with beautiful soft-body simulation physics. You can mod those same vehicles to be racing beasts, derby monsters, or off-road behemoths - or just thrash them stock. At the end of the day, BeamNG. drive gives you the gameplay you want, and doesn\'t force you to do anything that you don\'t think is fun or interesting. The future of the game and our physics engine As we optimize our game and computer technology improves, the amount of vehicles which can be simultaneously simulated at a smooth framerate will increase. Right now you can run 4 to 6 cars at one time on a high end quad-core processor. Each vehicle has around 400 nodes and 4000 beams, all being simulated 2000 times per second. We hope to expand the number of simultaneous vehicles possible to at least 8 with a mid-range processor. We will also look towards having multiplayer in the future, but it may be some time before we can create the multiplayer experience everyone is expecting. We are well aware of the demand for multiplayer and we want it just as much as you, but for the short term we are focusing on the single player career mode, various driving events, fixing bugs, and creating more content. It is feasible that we could implement local and/or same PC multiplayer in the interim. Also, the possibilities extend beyond land vehicles. Users in our community have already made planes and helicopters that fly purely with the existing vehicle aerodynamic physics, with no cheating whatsoever. BeamNG can simulate aircraft in a very authentic way due to its soft-body physics. All the flex that happens to a real plane\'s airframe arises naturally in BeamNG, and the consequences of excessive stress are also modeled. Fly too fast and your wings will start to bend and rip off. The potential for the BeamNG physics engine is huge. Alpha Access Features  All future updates to BeamNG. drive included for free (alpha, beta), also including the final game  Soft-body physics sandbox  19 detailed, customizable, destructible vehicles, with more to come  10 terrains to explore and drive across, with more to come  Frequent updates adding terrains, vehicles, features, gameplay, and bug fixes  Full modding and content creation capabilities - make maps and vehicles, and script gameplay  Use the built-in terrain editor and any 3D modeling, image editing, and text editing software  Online authentication is only necessary to update; the game itself does not need an internet connection to run. Alpha Testers Users that already entered the alpha testing via our website can get a free Steam key. Our goals Our main focus is on how things move rather than how things look on the screen. We aim to bring our expertise in real time soft-body physics and soft-body physics model design to the forefront of game physics simulation, making available the technology and know-how to as a wide an audience as possible. To achieve this, we are designing the engine and corresponding assets, so as to be independent of the underlying game engine and operating system. Right now the physics engine is running on a multicore CPU configuration, but we are also in the process of supporting GPUs via OpenCL. Our mission To have realistic, accurate, destructible, and malleable physics everywhere. To make anything possible.

The goal is simple: don\'t get hit. You have no weapons to fight back though. That would be too easy. In fact, you can\'t even move very fast. Your only way through is to guide the incoming waves into each-other through subtle and careful shifts. Violence is the last refuge of the incompetent, after all. Better to guide your opponent into destroying itself. The game is composed of many environments, each of which has a unique style and set of missiles, as well as its own sound profile. Each will require a different strategy, and produces more interesting types of missiles as you advance. All of this is done to a procedurally-generated soundtrack that is completely driven by what happens in the game.

Take charge of the US or Soviet space agencies - your duty is be the first to the moon. Carefully manage your budget by opening programs, spending R&D funds on improving the hardware, recruiting personnel and launching space missions in this realistic turn based strategy game. Road to the Moon features the race to the Moon, the historical event that started in the early 1960s and that ended in July 1969, after the successful completion of the Apollo 11 mission. The game features both a campaign and a sandbox mode. In campaign mode, you will be able to play as the Director of either NASA or the Soviet Space Agency in order to beat the other side to be the first on the Moon. You can also lead the  Global Space Agency (GSA), an fictional space agency that combines programs from all the major space agencies in the world . In the GSA campaign, you will need to address the requests and short-term goals issued by government, and is geared towards those players who prefer a game experience focused on exploration instead of competition.  Alternatively, all three space agencies feature a Sandbox mode, which provides a more open-ended experience and allows you to try out different approaches without any political pressure. You will be able to develop dozens of programs. Some examples include the X-15 and the PKA space planes, the Sputnik satellite, the Mercury, Voskhod, Apollo and Soyuz manned spacecraft and the Mars Viking probe. You are not limited to missions that did launch, as as the game also allows you to try out many concepts that were planned but that never left the drawing board. For example, instead of sending men to the Moon using the Lunar Orbit Rendezvous (LOR) approach used by Project Apollo in the late 1960s and early 1970s, you will be able to rewrite history and use either the alternative Gemini Earth Orbit Rendezvous (EOR) or Gemini Direct Ascent (DA) schemes. The number of options available ensure every game will be different and there is huge replay value. To verify its accuracy and authenticity, the game, is being developed in consultation with Dr. Buzz Aldrin, former U.S. Air Force combat pilot (66 missions in Korea) and NASA astronaut, who took part in the first Moon landing mission and became the second human being to walk on the Moon. If you have any interest in space exploration and the events that transpired during the \'Race to the Moon\', this is a game you just do not want to miss!

The Sandbox mode allows you to play as  any of the three space agencies and removes all competition restrictions. You will have a fully featured playground in order to try out different approaches to space exploration! Create space programs and launch missions inspired by real programs such as the X-15 Space plane, the Sputnik satellite, the Gemini, Vostok and Apollo manned spacecraft and a lot more! Research and develop dozens of mission components from several program categories. Develop your facility with advanced structures and upgrades including the Vehicle Assembly Building and the Mission Control Centre. Recruit and train astronaut candidates and assign them to missions.

There are different economic strategy games and they can be broken down to subtypes but from our viewpoint Caesar encompasses planning, constructing, diplomacy and military campaigns. Economy and Trade Miniature model of an economy leaves the ruler no room for mistakes, under his leadership there are extractive industry (mines, sawmills, outcrop mines and farms) and production (factories, armories, wineries and brandy kitchens). And if some resource is scarce or not available, then trade with the neighbors can be a solution for the difficult situation. Mini-economy is complicated and takes into account a variety of facts: taxes, import/export, population of the town, healthcare, unemployment. In order to stay in the black it is necessary to develop houses with high income level but that can lead to a rise in unemployment which consequently results in big problems such as an embezzlement of municipal purse. Construction Construction is defined by the needs of the town, healthcare, procurement, buildings security provision. The main idea of construction is bringing workers to the area, there actors entertain the public, engineer provides service for shabby houses, vigils fight criminals.  Moreover, city folk prefer to occupy quiet picturesque location such as gardens farther from dirty barns and noisy barracks. Diplomacy  The emperor will not leave the town alone, Caesar himself will demand goods for his personal use, sometimes in huge amounts and with bad timing. If the player has enough nerve he/she can just turn a blind eye to Caesar which unfortunately results in game over. Therefore, it is important to stay friends with Caesar and send him presents such as modest donations or exotic animals. Towns in the neighborhood will also take part in common trade network of the Empire and compete in the deals with the town. Religion Romans were superstitions people and created the whole hierarchy of gods. 5 gods are in the game: - Earth goddess, Ceres, when worshiped in the right way doubles the yield capacity. - Restive Neptune can help the merchants have a successful voyage. - Sly Mercurius can fill all barns and storage houses up to the roof. - Spirit of Mars protects the town from foes brave enough to attack the town. - Venus can brighten up the mood of city folk for a long time. Attitude of the City Folk The attitude of the city folk to you will be very important, if the reputation of the ruler is bad it can start the emigration, then criminal rate increases - riots, fires and many other problems occur. Therefore, it is necessary to take care of the people and analyse current deficiency. Healthcare is provided by hospitals and bath houses. Entertainment is fence play and chariot-riding. Food comes from farms and the sea. Religion and security are at control of the regular army. Military Set-up The city has to be protected from invasions of barbarians, the creation of bastille lies ahead, soldiers and barracks can be situated there as well as recruit depot. However, this is a way to recruit only varmint velites and reckless equites. Roman army is its legionnaires and they are heavily armored with helmets and shields that means a demand for ore and iron which are not so easy to excavate. But even if you have 2 cohorts of legionnaires nobody is free of fear therefore there is a need in a military academy where soldiers can have additional training in survival and ethics.

Now the same Mac & PC classic that was BANNED AROUND THE WORLD is back! Carmageddon features real-world environments that have been turned into killing fields, where the locals stay out on the streets at their peril. As well as using your car as a weapon, every level is sprinkled generously with power-ups that have a vast variety of mad effects, adding a whole extra level of craziness to the proceedings. In every event you have the option to �play it your way�� Waste all your opponents, kill every pedestrian, or (perish the thought) complete all the laps. Oh and watch out � the cops in their super-tough armoured patrol vehicles are lurking, and if they catch you being bad they�ll be down on you like several tons of cold pork. \"Ladies and gentlemen, start your engines! Members of the public, you have ONE minute to reach minimum safe distance!\" Crazy range of vehicles and drivers, each with their own personality and driving style.

The aim is for the player to work their way up the ranking system, from 99th place to first. The player vehicle is pitted against a number of computer controlled competitors, in locations such as cities, mines and desert towns. Levels can be beaten in one of three ways: Completing all the laps of the race course, as one would a normal racing game. \"Wasting\" (wrecking) all the opponents vehicles. Killing all the pedestrians in the area. Each level has a time limit, but more time may be gained by passing through checkpoints, collecting powerups, damaging/destroying the competitors\' cars, and by running over pedestrians (with bonuses awarded for style). These actions also reward the player with Credits, which can be used to make instant repairs or recover the car (after falling down a chasm, for example). They can also be used to upgrade Armour, Power and Offense stats in the Parts Shop between races. This is also the time to switch which car to drive if others have been obtained. As well as opponents partaking in the \'race\', some levels also contain a number of heavily armored Cop Cars, which will activate their sirens and hound the player when provoked. They can be attacked and destroyed, but do not count as opponents. A single \"Super Squad Car\" exists in one level, and it can be claimed if destroyed. An Action Replay with multiple camera viewpoints is available at any point during a race. Carmageddon won the �Game of the Year� trophy in the 1997 PC Zone Reader awards. Carmageddon 1 & 2 were �Driving Game of the Year� 1997/1998. SELECTED REVIEWS OF THE ORIGINAL GAME Originally released for the PC in 1997, Carmageddon was an instant hit and the titles went on to sell over 2 million copies worldwide. Here�s what a sample of the gaming press thought at the time: �Carmageddon is visceral, violent, vehicular fun...� - GameSpot 8.8 out of 10 �Carmageddon, to get straight to the point, is one of the best computer games I\'ve ever played� Carmageddon is God!� - Duncan McDonald 95% Classic Award PC Zone Magazine �Carmageddon is one of those games that only come along once in a blue moon. An essential purchase.� - Escape Magazine 6 out of 6 �The gameplay is spot on and anyone with a dark enough sense of humour should give it a go.� - Computer Gaming World 4 out of 5 �So next time you gun down coppers on GTA VI, just remember, Carmageddon�s controversy was there first, and you have a lot to thank it for.� - RetroGarden Carmageddon is the first of a series of graphically violent driving-oriented video games. It was conceived and developed by Stainless Games, published by SCi and released June 30, 1997 on PC & Mac. It was, and remains, a poster child for video game controversy. The controversy surrounded the game\'s central premise; that of earning reward for running down innocent pedestrians. The game was notable for its realistic and ground-breaking physics, and for its in-game action replay features. It was also one of the earliest examples of a sandbox 3D driving game, and may have influenced other later games including the Driver and Grand Theft Auto series. ABOUT STAINLESS GAMES Stainless was founded in 1994 by Patrick Buckland, a veteran of the games industry going back to the Jurassic period of 1982, and Neil Barnden, who used to have hair like a mammoth. A team of 8 worked on the original Carmageddon at Stainless, and 5 are still with the company today, although a couple of them are now kept manacled in a small padded room in the cellar. Stainless Games now employs around one hundred mad, dedicated people of assorted gender, height and width. They can all be found dangling precariously from a small chalky rock just off the South Coast of England. http://www.carmageddon.com/bugger http://www.carmageddon.com '),

It is a turn based regional game with an emphasis on playability and historical accuracy. It is built on the renowned AGE game engine, with a modern and intuitive interface that makes it easy to learn yet hard to master. This  historical operational strategy game with a simultaneous turn-based engine (WEGO system) that places players at the head of the USA or CSA during the American Civil War (1861-1865). You take the part of the military and political leadership, trying to lead your nation to victory, in the midst of some of the toughest operations of the Civil War. You will build, organize and command your armies over one of the largest maps of the USA ever made for a Civil War game. There are a host of real military leaders to appoint with their own strengths and weaknesses and choosing the right man for the job is crucial. However you are not just a military leader and must make vital economics and political decisions. These can have far reaching effects and you can even influence foreign intervention from the French & British who were constantly intervening in America for power and prestige. Each turn lasts 2 weeks and you must issue your orders in advance, planning on where the enemy will be, not where they are now � which is called a WEGO system (We Go at the same time). Orders are executed simultaneously in 14 phases � 1 per day. Battles are resolved on the day they occur so scheduling the arrival of your forces and planning the logistics or your army are key to success. You can send a massive force to assault an enemy position but if you do not carefully plan the attack you can have you troops arriving piecemeal and being easily dispatched. The WEGO system adds excitement and suspense and is far more realistic than traditional turn based games. This is must have game for anyone interested in the period or grand strategy games in general. Features Setting: the game covers all of the USA, from the Eastern seaboard to the Rockies, from 1861 to 1865. Mexico and the Northern Caribbean are also in Game map is divided into more than 3,000 regions, with a variety of terrain, climates and development level.

Gateway to Caen focuses on the largest, concentrated British offensive since the Normandy landings in an attempt to penetrate the German lines west of Caen and cross the Odon River to get the stalled advance moving again. With Close Combat: Gateway to Caen you can play at the strategic and tactical level, putting yourself in the boots of both the generals and the platoon commanders. You can move or combine your battlegroups on the strategic level and decide the outcome of battles on the tactical level. You will command squads in close combat situations, using small arms, mortars, machine guns, armored cars, and tanks to triumph against the enemy. You command artillery and mortar barrages and even air strikes. You will get to know individual solders, platoons, battalions, and the larger brigades and battle groups which they comprise. Players can experience the desperate situation of the outnumbered, but well-armed Panzergrenadiers, or the daunting offensive mission of the fully-supported British infantry advancing across the treacherous Odon Valley. At your command are Churchill, Cromwell, Firefly, Sherman, Stuart tanks and more. Panther, Tiger, Stug, and Mk.IV tanks will arrive to support German Panzergrenadiers as they try to hold the line against a concerted British attack. The historic scope of Operation Epsom is captured in single battles, operations, and the grand campaign. The strategic battlefield offers over two dozen individual battlefields with over three dozen accurately portrayed German and British battle groups. British infantry regimental history is reflected in name among the various battalions. You can deploy your battalions as they actually fought in the struggle for the Odon. The game includes all new maps and a range of upgraded effects. The Setting With the success of the Allied landings at Normandy and their domination of air and sea, expectations were high that the momentum would continue on land. It was not to be so. Though initially surprised and overwhelmed, the German Army quickly recovered, mobilized, and, counterattacked. Field Marshal Rommel formed a capable defense in Normandy that made the Allied advance costly. Superior Allied artillery and air power failed to crack the German lines. Though the Norman City of Caen was originally a British D-Day objective, its capture would elude and frustrate Montgomery�s 21st Army for weeks to come. Operation Epsom was Field Marshall Montgomery�s first concentrated attempt to go around the city and the Odon River, and break through the strengthening German bulwark. The newly-arrived British VIII Corps, supported by 700 guns of the Royal Artillery made a go of it along a four-mile front between Rauray and Carpiquet. Defending that front was the infamous 12th SS Panzer Division. Though reduced by weeks of heavy fighting they remained a potent and experienced foe. The Germans had offensive plans too, but the British struck first, and the 2nd SS Panzer Corps, the last of Germany�s offensive reserves in Normandy, was instead committed to stopping the British breakthrough along the Odon. Can you, as Montgomery and his commanders, re-chart the course of the Normandy campaign and prevail against Germany�s SS Panzer divisions?  Can you as the Germans, once again stop Montgomery, or eclipse history and push the British back entirely? Features Completely revised graphics that elevate battle effects, units, and maps to a new, detailed level in the Close Combat Series. Thirty new battlefield maps accurately reflect the Odon Valley west of Caen, France. 65 vehicles, 36 infantry units, 77 weapons. New vehicles and guns including Churchill, Cromwell, M-10 Achilles, and Firefly tanks; 17-pdr AT guns, Loyd Carriers, and more. Improved graphics and effects and new soldier voices.

More about the game You win by either scoring the most Victory Points (VPs) or being the first to reach a certain preset VP threshold, depending on scenario and custom choices in the main menu. To do so, you must capture regions over the world, and defeat your enemies in battle. The world has about 130 regions open to conquest. The regions have variable income and VP values (set randomly in the Standard scenario) and unknown until conquered or spied upon. Each region not owned by a Major Power usually has an independent Minor country owning and defending it. Each Major country is controlled by a human player or the computer, or is designated neutral and then acts as a Minor country. Hotseat play is possible, with an option to limit to 4.00 minutes the playing time per player. Each game turn represents roughly one season. Game lasts till victory conditions are achieved. Scenarios: game offers 3 scenarios: one starting in the year 1880 with an historical setting, one in 1914 with historical positions, and an open ca-1870 standard where nation only own their starting home territories (free-for-all non-historical) The game has 3 main phases, each player entering them in sequence, i.e. Build Phase (Spring only, with: Army & Navy Construction, Fortification, Economic Aid, Espionage, Subversion),  Movement Phase (Army & Navy),  and Combat Phase. Gameplay of each phase is rather simple and straightforward, as follows: Army and Navy Build Phase (Spring):  Create new armies and fleets in your Supply Centers Fortification Phase (Spring): Fortify army units (except in Supply Centers which are already fortified). Economic Aid Phase (Spring): Lend money to other Major countries; which is added to their Treasury. Or Lend money to neutral Minor countries; which they use immediately to build armies. Espionage Phase (Spring): Learn the approximate (not always accurate) army strength and the income of a Minor country or of an region controlled by a Major country. And the region�s VP value Subversion Phase (Spring): Spend money to bribe a Minor country\'s army, weakening the country\'s defense or causing a coup (giving you control of the said country in return). Movement Phase (All turns): Move armies to adjacent regions only. Move navies alone or with armies from one port to another (or carry regiments to amphibious landings on enemy holdings). Combat Phase (All turns): up to twenty rounds of battle; each consists of naval (if ships are present) then land battles '),

Explore a random generated world populated by dangerous creatures, build a dwarf fortress, gather resources, and craft all the items, weapons, and armor you need. GOD-SIMULATION You control a tribe of dwarves by giving them commands to dig in certain places, attack enemy creatures, and build houses and other structures. You\'ll need to provide your dwarves food and clothing, as well as help them with magic when fighting against other inhabitants of the world. You start the game with one dwarf and gain additional dwarves as your experience level increases. SANDBOX GAME Each game level has many layers of earth to explore, from the sky down to boiling subterranean lava. The level is randomly generated as an island, restricted by natural boundaries: oceans on the edges, lava beneath it, and the sky above. Other features include day and night and changing weather conditions. The worlds differ in size, humidity, temperature, terrain, and flora and fauna. Abandoned halls and rooms with treasure are hidden somewhere deep within the islands. CRAFTING One feature of the game is a user-friendly system of recipes for crafting. The recipes are organized and easily accessible. You can craft dozens of different items: building blocks for houses, furniture, decorations, weapons, armor, ammunition, and food for your dwarves. RTS At the outset you find the recipes for basic tools and items, and build a small house with places to sleep and eat. Then, the size of the tribe increases and catches the attention of other inhabitants of the world. Most of them are night creatures and dwell underground. The worlds are full of fantasy creatures like zombies, skeletons, goblins, beholders, ghosts, giant spiders, and others. Some of them pay little attention to the dwarves, as long as the dwarves do not come into their field of vision. Others gather into quite large groups and try to break into the dwarves� residence. TOWER DEFENSE Especially dangerous are the waves of monsters that appear from time to time from portals. So, do not neglect to build a safe haven with strong walls and numerous trapdoors, cells, firing towers, and secret passageways. MAGIC As a divine being, you possess various spells. You can speed up the movement of the dwarves, open small portals, illuminate dark caves to scare away monsters, evoke natural magic in the form of rain or tree growth, hurl fireballs at the monsters� heads, and find useful resources and hidden rooms underground, thereby helping to speed up resource extraction, exploration of the world, and the population growth of your assistants.'),

His followers are well versed in every extortion, infiltration and martial art. Pony and Biki are his best students, his pride and joy. The duo knows the secret chakra technique like the back of their hand (or hoof in Pony\'s case). Together they rule the city and its surroundings. Although everyone respects and fears them they are hunted by law enforcement agencies. They are Ninjas. Crouching Pony Hidden Dragon (CPHD) is a brand-new Action/RPG game developed for SNK�s Neo Geo console which came out in 1990. It might look like a straight-forward arcade game, but under the surface is a persistent world with a rich and varied set of rules. In CPHD �Run�N Gun� mechanics from the likes Shock Troopers or Ninja commando are combined with playful �RPG� ones from games like Zelda or Secret of Mana. You\'ll need to explore every level to find the resources necessary for your progress: coins, health bonuses, resurrection potions, special Ninja techniques, etc. Treasure chests are hidden everywhere. You�ll have to find them to afford equipment upgrades from the ninja shops. In addition Pony and Biki gain experience points by defeating enemies, becoming more powerful over time. Be careful though: you�ll have to use your resources wisely. Health is limited so if you don\'t equip yourself at the armory you\'re in for a hard time. Money is limited too however: you\'ll need to choose these investments carefully! Make new friends: a local multiplayer co-op mode lets a second player drop in at any time. It�s even more fun, even more frantic and even more strategic! Lose old friends: there are the same numbers of resources no matter how many players there are; will you share or will you hog everything? Have a good adventure! Why create a game for Neo Geo? Several reasons pushed us to develop for this console. The Neo-Geo is a legend amongst consoles, and is the one we dreamed of throughout our childhood and teenage years. For this reason, when we decided to bring our main character �Ninja Pony� to life, we wanted his early adventures to take place in the Neo-Geo universe. Thus we are offering our beloved Pony this welcoming present: to be born into the world of this �Rolls Royce� of consoles. Having our character emerge on cartridge is a way of enshrining him in the Pantheon of video game heroes, alongside Sonic and Mario. It\'s a way of going back in time! It also made sense with regards to the character\'s back-story. Crouching Pony Hidden Dragon relates the teenage years of Ninja Pony. This parallels the advent of the Neo-Geo in the history of video games: this console personifies gaming\'s teenage years. Last but not least there were technical challenges we were eager to overcome. We realized that there were very few traces of the tools and documentation required to develop games on Neo-Geo. What\'s more this arcane knowledge was gradually disappearing! We had to become archaeologists, investigating, looking for clues, piecing together how these games were developed. We created our own software and hardware pipe-lines, started working directly in pixel art again, etc. We were able to leverage our experience working on �modern� video games in returning to blow the dust off these old techniques. It was an exciting job, a true act of video game craftsmanship! Why bring the game to PC? When we announced the Neo Geo version many expressed regret at not being able to play the game. Since our main ambition at Le Cortex is to offer original play experiences to as many people as possible we wanted to avoid restricting the release to Neo-Geo connoisseurs and collectors. So we decided to port the game to the gamers\' platform of today: the PC. And in case you were wondering this is indeed a full native port, not the Neo-Geo ROM being run via an emulator! About Le Cortex Le Cortex is an independent French Studio located in Paris. We design, write and develop games which aim to offer brand new play experiences.'),

Damned is a randomized online horror game for up to 5 players (4 survivors and 1 monster). You�ll be able to play as one of four people trapped in different haunted places (hotels, hospitals, etc). As a survivor your main objective will be finding your way out, as well as helping your friends get out too. You�ll often find yourself on the edge, hearing and seeing ghostly things, trying to find keys and items to help in your escape. And sometimes you�ll find yourself running desperately from a monster, who�s there only to find and kill you and your friends. You�ll also be able to play as the monster. The game will feature different monsters, each one unique in its gameplay and hunting style. - What kind of horror game is Damned? Damned explores the sense of being defenseless against a powerful supernatural force. The survivors can�t directly affect the monster in any way. When it�s there to get you, your only chance is to run and hide. This perception of being defenseless is very strong, primal and terrifying, it builds up anxiety and makes you really scared, fearing any unexplained noise or movement. This is how Damned creates horror in a multiplayer game session, and we believe it to be super effective! (tested and approved!) - Why is Damned a randomized game? Every stage in Damned is randomized: Almost all the objects in a stage may or may not appear; The item system is fully random too, randomizing which item will appear in the game, and where it\'ll be; The way to win a match as a survivor is also randomized; Even the stage may trigger random events to scare the survivors inside. - Why is Damned a competitive and cooperative game? Because in a full game, with 4 survivors and 1 monster, there�ll be a survivor �team� cooperating to try and escape together, and at the same time they�ll be competing against a monster, trying to flee from him and deny each one of its attempt to hunt and kill a survivor. - How to play as a survivor? As a survivor you�ll be cooperating with your friends (up to 4 survivors in a single game session): You and your friends will be searching the level for keys and items to help in your escape; Each survivor will have a flashlight that can be turned on and off, helping you see your surroundings, but at the same time letting the monster know where you are; The survivors will be able to manipulate objects throughout the hotel, like drawers, doors, safes, cabinets, wardrobes; Challenge yourself to find the exit and get out alive. - How to play as the monster? As the monster, your game will be all about competing alone against the survivors team. The game will feature different monsters, each one unique in its play style. It\'s up to you to play a few rounds with each monster and decide which one works best for you. How are you going to hunt and kill the survivors? - Why is Damned worth buying? Because it�s fun! It�s really scary, you�ll find yourself on the edge a lot of times, trying to evade the monster or trying to pay closer attention because you don�t know if the sound you just heard is some random noise or if it is the monster haunting you. It�s a real horror game, it explores deeply the feeling of being completely defenseless against a powerful force that can finish you easily. Your only choice is to run and hide! And also because it�s really fun to play as the monster as well. You�ll keep haunting and building up anxiety in people, making them terribly scared of you. We really put you in the skin of a terrifying monster. - Links and contact: Got any questions and/or suggestions?

To fill the void, Demigods from across from the mortal world must wage war against one another in a bid to ascend to true godhood. Set in a magical world where gods walk among mortals, Demigod blends action, strategy and role-playing elements into a thrilling new experience. Select the Demigod that will lead your minions into battle and unleash the dogs of war against your rivals. Your Demigod will do whatever it takes in order to ascend to true godhood. Once in the Arena, each Demigod will be joined by support troops that fight to the death as you struggle to seize key control points and slowly turn the tide of war in your favor. And your Demigod will level up during the course of each battle, becoming even more powerful as you unlock new abilities and powers. It\'s a brutal conflict of Demigod versus Demigod, where the very ground beneath their feet will tremble and quake. Demigod is a real-time, tactical strategy game that includes extensive role-playing elements. Choose from several Demigods, each poised for battle with their own unique capabilities and awe-inspiring powers. Vanquish other would-be gods as you gain levels, increase in power, unlock the power of mystic artifacts and slowly battle your way closer to joining the Pantheon. Key features: Revolutionary strategy/action game that combines tactical prowess with role-playing depth. Your Demigod is the focus of your power in the arena. Each of the 8 included Demigods has unique powers and abilities. Like a role-playing game, players can purchase equipment for their Demigod, add new powers to their Demigod as it gains experience, acquire artifacts that remain persistent between games. Each Demigod plays differently enough that it provides a diverse gaming experience. Like a strategy game, players have strategic objectives in each arena that, when captured, provide resources that give access to better units and some Demigods have the ability to summon their own minions that they can individually control. There are gold mines that can be captured to give more resources, artifact shops that, if captured, make their resources available to your team. Battle in a persistent online world in multiplayer or play single player either in a skirmish or in the virtual tournament. The on-line pantheon allows players to \"skirmish\" against other players of similar skill or take part in the on-line Pantheon tournament where players choose the path of light or darkness and earn favor points to help their faction win the tournament. Players can also play on the LAN or play custom games with friends on the Internet. Players earn favor points through victory with different awards given for different achievements during the game. These favor points can be used to purchase special items that exist from game to game. Increase your Demigod\'s powers and abilities by leveling up during each battle. In each game, your Demigod will start at level 1. As you kill enemy grunts and Demigods and capture flags, you gain experience which will cause your Demigod to gain experience levels. When a new experience level is gained, the player can add new skills and abilities to their Demigod to make him or her more powerful. Wage massive, earth-shattering battles across a series of awe-inspiring Arenas. Demigod makes use of the same awesome technology as Supreme Commander. However, it has been greatly enhanced with Gas Powered Games\' new \"mesh\" technology that allows the game to have incredible visuals even on older video cards. The arenas in Demigod are not your typical \"maps\". Instead, they have each been crafted as a full blown 3D model unto itself in which players battle on the surface of them. Seize key, strategic positions on the map and turn the tide against your enemy. Push deep into their base and destroy them once and for all. Key resources in an arena are controlled by capturing the flag associated to that resource. When a player controls that resource, the entire team benefits. Controlling flags also generates war points which are added to your team\'s war score. When enough war points are collected, new upgrades in the team\'s Citadel become available for purchase. '),

EARTH 2150: ESCAPE FROM THE BLUE PLANET The 21st century was supposed to herald the dawn of a new age. The wars, famines and suffering of the last 20 millennia were to become a distant, fading memory, as scientific advances brought global peace and prosperity. Toward the end of the 20th century, a now forgotten US president even went so far as to officially proclaim the arrival of a New World Order, in which right, not might, would govern international relations. This bright future was not to be. First came a meltdown of the international stock and currency exchanges. Then the major international conglomerates were dissolved in a vain attempt to stop the fiscal hemorrhage. By 2012 the world economy had collapsed. Poverty and hunger caused social and political tensions to flare. As the crisis wore on, few were bold or naive enough to predict anything positive for the future. Most realized that the planet was on the verge of global conflict. In 2048, the anticipated global conflict broke out with a violence that shook the planet to its core. All major centralized governments were destroyed in the maelstrom. Europe and Eastern Asia bore the brunt of the devastation, as entire urban centres, from Madrid to Moscow and from Seoul to Singapore were literally wiped off the map. The human race has always been known for its resiliency. Within a dozen years, the Earth\'s inhabitants had begun to restore their old nationalities - with a few twists. Twelve states of the former United States joined together to form a new country, called the United Civilized States. The UCS citizens had essentially given up their old roles as producers and leaders. Nearly all work was being performed by robots which are controlled by expert computer systems. Not surprisingly, the human inhabitants of the UCS had become lazy and decadent. The 20th-century dream for a better world had ended in death and destruction. EARTH 2150: THE MOON PROJECT The year 2150 � one of the blackest chapters in the history of mankind. While the Lunar Corporation, Eurasian Dynasty and the United Civilized States are preparing themselves for the last all-encompassing battle, work is being feverishly carried out on a secret project on the Moon. Only the code name of this project is known ���� \"SUNLIGHT\" EARTH 2150: LOST SOULS It is the 7th of December 2150 � in a few hours our beloved planet Earth will no longer exist. Devastating wars between the Eurasian Dynasty and the United Civilized States have wreaked havoc and caused mortal wounds to our planet, but that is not all, a series of nuclear explosions close to the Antarctic had changed the Earth�s orbit around the sun, glaciers melted, the sea rose to a threatening level, and meteorite showers buried whole parts of the world. Famous scientists from the Lunar corporation, a long forgotten colony on the moon first recognized the signs of the imminent catastrophe. According to their calculations  the distance between the sun and earth would decrease in the next few years by 17%, which would lead to terrible consequences. The only hope left for the population was the escape to the red planet Mars. Hurry up, cause time is ticking away....'),

EHM offers fans the most realistic, in-depth and immersive simulation of hockey management available, giving them the chance to manage either club or country in any of the world�s top hockey-playing nations. EHM allows you to take full control of your roster � you decide who to sign, who to trade and who to draft. You assemble the perfect coaching team and then, with everything in place, you can choose to either employ a head coach to guide your team from behind the bench, or take control of the coaching duties yourself. Whichever you choose, you can follow the action �live� or watch the game highlights afterwards through the realistic �top down� 2D game engine. To mark its move from Early Access to full availability, EHM now offers a number of new and updated features, including: a greater number of playable domestic leagues and cup competitions; Steam Workshop integration; additional screen resolutions and a multiplayer option which allows up to 30 players to compete against one another and many more improvements inspired by user feedback. Eastside Hockey Manager � Key Features Dynamic 2D Game Engine Follow the action in either your own games or those of your rivals through the advanced �top-down�, 2D game engine, which incorporates state-of-the-art physics modelling (including realistic deflections and shot-blocking) and convincing player AI. There�s even a zoom mode for those who want to get closer to the action. Realistic Contemporary Game World A detailed game world where players can manage and coach in more than 30 playable domestic leagues and cup competitions from across the globe, each of which features up-to-date rules and league structures. Multiplayer Action Up to 30 players can compete head to head in in the same online game world. Steam Workshop Integration EHM includes support for the inclusion of user-generated content (such as custom databases and graphics) through the easy-to-use Steam Workshop system. Complete Roster Management Full control over the building and management of your roster, including everything from offering contracts to scouting, drafting promising players and trading with other teams. Complete Personnel Management Full control over non-playing personnel, including the ability to sign coaches, scouts and physios. Total Tactical Control Coaches can get the best out of their roster by creating and managing detailed tactics that can be configured to an entire team, an individual unit or even a single player. Lifelike Trade Negotiations Managers can gauge interest to trade proposals from their opposite numbers as well as getting feedback from their own assistant. Each team has their own needs and some are ready to offload prospects for that key veteran that makes them a true contender whilst others might be looking to move high-earning veterans in order to rebuild through the draft. Intuitive User Interface The centralised navigation bar makes management easier and more intuitive with all key management controls incorporated into the main menu bar. Improved Player Progression Players develop and age naturally, with new players coming through the junior systems and older players eventually retiring or moving on into non-playing careers. Furthermore, the role-based attribute modelling makes players more realistic and more varied. International Management EHM includes the opportunity to manage international teams (including U20s) in all of the key tournaments � and many less high-profile competitions too. Database Import The database format allows the importing of user-generated up-to-date rosters and even historical starting databases (created for earlier versions of EHM). And Much, Much More� �including detailed fiNo description availablecial modelling of player contracts, salary caps and player budgets; a nation overview screen which allows you to view all of the top leagues, clubs and players for each country; player/non-player profiles; an option to start the game with a fantasy draft; all-star games with skills competitions and many, many other features.'),

The onslaught just keeps on building with new challenges the further you progress. You\'ll need to be super focused if you want a place on the global high score table, one blink and it can be all over! Echoes+ is a showcase game made using App Game Kit 2 (AGK). You can learn more about App Game Kit 2 here: http://store.steampowered.com/app/325180/ Echoes mode Echoes mode consists of 10 levels of blasting action, each introducing a new enemy with different strengths & weaknesses. When you get hit you lose energy but it can be replenished by collecting green power ups. Getting hit may also downgrade your weapon, but act fast and you can power it back up again. Increased kills means more power-ups. Time Attack Just want a quick blast? Then try time attack. In this mode you have to score as many points as you can in 3 minutes.  You get unlimited energy but being hit incurs a points penalty. Tips The secret to a high score is collecting multipliers. The more enemies you kill the more multiplier power-ups will be dropped. Shooting stars will always drop a score multiplier. Warning! Points lost if hit are linked to the score multiplier. Survivor Mode This is all about how long you can survive without taking a hit. The score is irrelevant! Tips Your weapon will power up over time automatically. Time is your priority so shooting enemies might not always be the best approach. Destroying planets might be risky but they drop shields which will protect you for 10 seconds, invaluable in this game mode. Classic Mode This has a simpler game play and modified controls making it more like the 80\'s retro games. Tips Use smaller and more controlled movements than in other game modes. Try and stay away from the edge of the play area whenever possible. Listen out for the warning sounds that mean a saucer is approaching. Meteor Storm Mode This challenges you to fend off increasingly frequent and dense waves of meteors. Destroy the golden meteors & collect score multipliers. Tips Your ship starts with a fixed amount of energy which cannot be replenished. Getting hit reduces your energy but also causes you to drop some of your score multipliers. Your weapon power is fixed and cannot be increased. Asteroid Belt Mode Here you face snakes of energy that increase in both quantity and length at each new level. Tips Your ship starts with a fixed amount of energy which cannot be replenished. The score multiplier is linked to the number of asteroid belts at the start of the current level. Your weapon power is fixed and cannot be increased. Zoo Trials (zoots) These are a series of additional challenges. Each zoot can be attempted on any of the four difficulty levels, with harder difficulties contributing more towards your total completion percentage; Easy = 1%, Normal = 2%, Hard = 3% and Insane = 4% Only the hardest difficulty achieved counts towards your total, so for the ultimate 100% score you need to complete each of the 25 zoots on insane difficulty. Zoots can only be completed in specific game modes so make sure you check these on the zoo trials menu screen. The Pause screen shows your progress towards and zoots.

It is meant to be an open creation platform so everybody can make their own characters, backgrounds or props and import them into FaceRig. (More on http://facerig.com ) FaceRig is being developed by Holotech Studios and the image-based face tracking SDK being used is provided by ULSee Inc. To find out more about ULSee Inc., visit http://ulsee.com or email them at info@ulsee.com . Our previous tracking technology was provided by Visage Technologies. FaceRig has three versions: FaceRig Classic is the base version of FaceRig, which allows for home non-profit use and even limited monetization on YouTube/Twitch or similar as long as the commercial aspect of it is not significant. We consider commercially significant using it on any avenue (channel) that produces you more than $500 monthly revenue. This includes ad-based revenue and voluntary donations (one time or recurrent such as a Patreon). If you are under this threshold you can use Classic, if you are above you need to upgrade to Pro or Studio. the FaceRig Pro DLC, which allows you to monetize videos on YouTube/Twitch regardless of the monthly revenue, but not for content exclusive to paid/subscription based services, such as the new YouTube Red (for content that is exclusive to YouTube Red or similar you will need FaceRig Studio). FaceRig Pro does not bring new assets, technical features or improvements to FaceRig Classic. For more details, take a look at the Pro DLC description the Studio Version allows commercial use, as well as  access to the expression mo-cap data. For more details about this version visit http://facerig.com We believe that FaceRig will entertain many gamers, modelling and animation artists, members of various fandoms, streamers, web casters, YouTubers and their audiences. For now we\'re focusing on just tracking and rendering the portrait with its expressions, but we aim to do more in the future. The FaceRig end goal is to provide a full featured real time digital actor set for home use. Key Features: Real time head and expression tracking in an input video stream, (also with audio analysis). Combining tracked data with additional virtual puppeteering input. On-the-fly animation re-targeting for the tracked data and applying the animation on a user selected 3d model, with audio processing (voice alteration) Rendering and lighting the animated model in real time, in a user selected background. Encoding the rendered video and sending it further as output from a virtual webcam (it basically intercepts webcam input, and swaps the images captured by your real webcam with the fantastic content before sending it further). Provide the interface for tuning the parameters of all operations above. Customizable avatars. To see the complete list on FaceRig avatars including the ones from DLC\'s please see: https://facerig.com/tips/tuesday-tips-0-avatar-list/ Open creation platform: you can make your own models (outside of FaceRig), import and use them as your avatars. The models need to be created according to  a set of published specs. Notes: Numeric export of the tracked expression data (exporting the motion capture data to use in other applications) is a feature reserved for the Studio version. FaceRig  Classic and Pro only output already rendered video and audio. FaceRig is an indie initiative, and its development so far has been successfully crowd-funded through Indiegogo.

FATTY MAZE�S STORY ?  Mr. Fatty Maze is the main character, a tourist who found a treasure map and ventured on a journey to find it. On its way to an island marked on the map, his plane crashes, but the brave traveler survives. He wakes up to find himself in a giant maze that he must escape from to reach the treasure.  ? GAMEPLAY ?  Your task will be to help the nice and unlucky character find a way out of this difficult situation by guiding him through the maze and, hopefully, taking him to the treasure chest. To do that, you will need all your concentration, logic, memory and patience. It�s a long and treacherous journey through a labyrinth where you will need to find keys to exit doors. You will encounter all kinds of obstacles, such as stones, plants, rivers, portals, crates and much more. You will also need to find many items that will help you overcome these obstacles. Each labyrinth is a unique exciting puzzle where you can easily get lost. However, if you find yourself in a dead end with no way out, you can always restart the game and try again. Sometimes even the weather will be a problem, making it hard for Mr. Fatty Maze to navigate through the maze in mist, during a blizzard, storm or night time. The game offers an exciting atmosphere, colorful graphics and animations, great music and sound effects, adventures in locations covered with jungle, ice and sand, over 50 types of levels, over 25 types of game items and obstacles and an amazingly beautiful and mysterious world!

You will be surprised to see how much better your memory and ability to solve logic puzzles will improve after beating the game! The game has no level time limitations, but the faster and more efficiently you beat a level, the more points you will get to compare your score with that of your friends. The game was created both for adults and their kids! The level editor to share after the game is released.

If his wife Patricia then wants to learn Swedish, Mark should then purchase the DLC store item entitled \"Influent DLC - Svenska [Learn Swedish].\" This can also be done from Patricia\'s perspective and will have the exact same result with Patricia purchasing the Swedish base game and then also buying the Latin DLC for Mark, herself, or even anyone else, to use on the same computer.

Check out the Community Hub for Frequently Asked Questions and other cool stuff! A BRIEF BACKGROUND Influent is a Language Learning Game focusing primarily on vocabulary acquisition and pronunciation. It was initially developed in Japan at the University of Tsukuba\'s Entertainment Computing Laboratory under the Monbukagakusho Government Research Scholarship . After research funding ran out, further funding from a wildly successful Kickstarter Campaign allowed for the completion of the game. A research paper on the ideas surrounding the game and its applications was published by the Information Processing Society of Japan (IPSJ), which can be viewed in its entirety here . Andrew Cross is infuriated! For three long years, he sat confined to his work, developing a device that he firmly believed to be a technological breakthrough in the way people would interact with the world around them. A device that could scan any object in the real world and then provide its name in any language! Duly dubbing his fancy new invention the \"SanjigenJiten,\" Andrew arranged an appointment to demonstrate the device\'s amazing capabilities at the world\'s largest technology corporation, Technoglobe International. But while on his visit, he fell for a girl he met in the lab, and while she stole his heart, someone else silently stepped in and stole his device! Now, Technoglobe has gone and swiftly marketed the SanjigenJiten as their own, even laying claim to the very name he had so cleverly concocted! But Andrew Cross has a plan. He\'s made an even better version of his SanjigenJiten and launched an online campaign, swearing to learn 300 words in a foreign language to raise awareness of Technoglobe\'s blatant theft and prove his device really works! But does the SanjigenJiten really work? Can Andrew actually pull it off?!'),

The double jump sprays paint bullets out of the player and increases the player�s awareness of their surroundings.

Create custom maps and content using the Insurgency SDK and scripting system, and share them on the Steam Workshop. Playable on PC, Mac OSX, and Linux with multiplayer cross-compatibility. Dedicated Server Support for PC and Linux. Multiplayer Game Modes: Push --- Three territorial objectives must be captured by the attacking team in sequential order. For each objective captured, they gain more reinforcement and time to attack the next. Defenders have a finite amount of reinforcements and must use each wisely. Once the third objective is captured by the attackers, a fourth cache objective must be destroyed, while the defenders have only one life to make a last stand. Firefight --- Three territorial objectives, one for each team, plus one neutral. Each team only respawns when they secure an objective. Secure all objectives or eliminate all enemy to win. Every life counts, making this a very suspenseful experience dependent upon teamwork. Skirmish --- In addition to three territorial objectives, each team has a supply cache to protect. Teams gain extra reinforcement waves until their cache is destroyed. When both teams have lost their caches and all reinforcement waves, it becomes a Firefight match. Occupy --- There is one central territorial objective in the area. The team that controls it does not deplete reinforcement waves. This gameplay in this mode is reminiscent to King of the Hill or \"tug of war\". Ambush --- A high value target (\"HVT\") must be escorted to an extraction point. It\'s one team\'s goal to make this happen and it\'s the other team\'s goal to stop this from happening at all costs. The HVT is only armed with a silenced pistol, but can pick up a weapon from a fallen enemy or teammate. Strike --- Three weapon caches must be destroyed by the attacking team to achieve victory. Destroying a cache earns the attackers more reinforcements and time on the clock. The defenders must retain at least one cache from being destroyed and eliminate the enemy team once their reinforcements run dry. Infiltrate --- The standard Capture the Flag mode, but with a twist. Your team\'s goal is to take the enemy\'s intel and return it to your base. Your team will only gain reinforcements when someone takes the enemy\'s intel, or when an enemy stealing your team\'s intel is neutralized. This mode requires very strong team coordination and strategy. Flashpoint --- One neutral territorial objective and two caches on each side. The goal is to secure the entire area, controlling the middle and destroying the enemy\'s caches. Your team respawns when they secure the territorial objective or destroy a cache objective. Elimination --- In this single life mode, attackers must destroy one of two weapon caches, or eliminate the enemy team within the time limit. Defenders must kill all attackers. Cooperative Game Modes Checkpoint --- Complete mission-based objectives in sequence against AI enemy. Each successful objective will respawn anyone who was eliminated along the way. Hunt --- Insurgents are dispersed in the environment, and your squad must eliminate all targets while locating and destroying the weapons cache. High on tension, with only one-life. Survival --- Play as Insurgents and fight against endless waves of progressively difficult Security enemies on night themed maps. Reaching safehouse objectives with your team earns you supply to purchase better weapons and spawns any dead teammates. Outpost --- Defend your supply cache against endless waves of enemy trying to destroy it. Each successfully defended wave will bring in reinforcements of your teammates. Conquer --- Capture the objectives in the area and defend them from enemy trying to retake them. Destroy enemy weapon caches to thin out their numbers.'),

The game will never seek to limit you or restrict your personal play style. Custom design as many characters as you want and build up a whole squad to fight for you. Characters will grow and become stronger with experience, not just in their stats but their appearance too. Original take on the RTS-RPG hybrid genre. No \"hero\" characters with artificially stronger stats than everybody else- Every character and NPC you meet is potentially an equal, and has a name, a life. You are not the chosen one. You\'re not great and powerful. You don\'t have more \'hitpoints\' than everyone else. You are not the center of the universe, and you are not special. Unless you work for it. Build a base where you can research new technologies, upgrade your defences and craft new gear. Purchase and upgrade your own buildings to use as safe fortified havens when things go bad, or use them to start up a business. Variation and possibilities of gameplay. Be good, be evil, be a businessman, be a thief, live in a town, live in the desert, travel alone, travel in hordes, build a fortress, raze a city. Devote yourself to freeing slaves, or maybe end up a slave yourself. Dynamic, ever changing world. Support or hinder whoever you wish, or keep to yourself, the world won\'t stop moving. This is not just a \"game\", you are living and surviving in a simulated world. Get captured by cannibals and eaten alive , or sold off by slavers and forced to work in the mines. These are not scripted events, just a regular part of this chaotic world that ruins your life by chance. Anything can happen, yet anything can be overcome if you have the strength. Absolutely no Level-scaling. The world does not level up along with you, and the shops don\'t change their inventory to only items matching your level. At the start of the game almost everyone will be stronger than you, and survival will always be a struggle. The game won\'t hold your hand or help you when you\'re down. Realistic medical system that affects gameplay. A character with a wounded leg will limp or crawl and slow the party down, wounded arms means you must use your sword one-handed or not at all. Severe injuries will result in amputees needing robotic limb replacements. Blood loss means you can pass out, and the blood will attract predators. A character�s stats are affected by equipment, encumbrance, blood loss, injuries and starvation. Intelligent AI that allows for characters to reason and work towards long-term goals and desires. Squads work together and carry their wounded to safety. Characters can be setup to take care of micromanagement for you and run production in your base.

Realistic Weather and Season Change The gaming world comes alive as you build and battle during winter or summer months, as you push your armies through heavy rain or snow storms.

Captain an Orc, Dwarf or Human warship and sail the turbulent Abyssal Ocean to play online multiplayer, in free-for-all or fleet based matches. The goal is to: Plunder as much gold as possible while outwitting and outgunning all others and be the last ship sailing. Be ruthless! Sink other players ships, take their loot and collect their bounty! Be greedy! Maps are littered with floating treasure chests and ships loaded with gold. Be cunning! As the match progresses hungry sea monsters become more aggressive and encroach the safe waters ships can sail in. Ships sailing in \'Dead Waters\' for too long end up as monster chow! Be unsinkable! At the end of a match ships can be upgraded and customized with captains, cannons, armor, mates and more! BOMBASTIC BROADSIDES! Cannons are the heart of combat in Maelstrom. Cannonballs are physics controlled, with a significant firing arc and hang time, meaning prediction and good aim are necessary to deal damage effectively. On the receiving end, players with good reactions and anticipation coupled with a nimble ship can dodge incoming fire. WARSHIPS WIN WITH WITS Enemy ships can be rammed, grappled and boarded! A clever captain at sea will become a wealthy captain on land.  Skillfully maneuver yourself through the swelling sea and prepare your ship for ramming.  The faster the ship is moving the more devastating the collision will be on impact! Looking for a friendlier approach? Hold both ships in place while crews fight it out. Grapples will be cut eventually, so boarding actions only last a short time. If one crew manages to kill all of the opposing crew, they will set fire to the enemy ship, sending it to the depths! ARMOR, AMMO AND POSITIONAL DAMAGE Each ship has armor on all four sides. The armor sections serve as additional defense toward damage to that side and must be destroyed before the ship\'s hull can be damaged. Maneuvering to keep your armor between you and your enemy is vital to staying afloat - and seeking the enemy\'s damaged sides will make you much more lethal in combat! Every cannon has access to three kinds of ammunition and can swap during combat to suit the situation. Ammo is unlimited. Iron shot blasts chunks out of ship armor and hull. Chain shot is used to shred enemy sails and cripple a ship�s speed. Grapeshot slaughters enemy crew and makes ships easier to board. LURKING THE DEEP Like the ocean they reside in, sea monsters are titanic forces of nature. They stalk unwary captains and can devour a ship whole. Like this Murkwater Thrasher. Each ship in Maelstrom is a character with a colorful history and unique weaponry as well as strengths and weaknesses such as speed, firepower, crew, and toughness. There are many unique ships available for players to unlock and explore. ASHBORNE, HUMAN FRIGATE  Ashborne has incredibly punishing broadsides and wields spell-infused incendiary ammo, unique to her, which ignites enemy ships! HUMANS The well designed ships of mankind\'s Phoenix Empire are the fastest afloat. Each ship is armed with a large number of the most modern cannons available, giving them unmatched range and broadside firepower. Great speed Powerful broadsides Great range ORCS The shark-driven ships of the orcs are incredibly maneuverable, and have a large number of forward-facing cannons making them deadly on the pursuit. The orcs themselves are ferocious fighters, unmatched in combat during boarding actions. Lethal boarding Great ramming Formidable agility DWARVES Dwarves disdain brittle wood and flimsy sail, instead forging steel armored steamships. Dwarven ships can withstand far more punishment than the ships of other races and are armed with massive giant cannons on all sides. Though not the most nimble, all Dwarf ships can switch gears and sail in reverse. Tough armor Omnidirectional cannons Ships can reverse No additional purchases are needed to enjoy the game to the fullest extent.

Merchants of Kaidan is a challenging trading game fused with lots of RPG elements. You start very humble, one cart, a purse of gold and silver coins is all that you have. Your task is to roam the world and search of opportunities to score some profit. Buy low, sell high -  a merchant\'s motto is easy to grasp. And yet the job is harder than it seems. A good merchant needs to know everything about the market, he is always on the lookout for a deal, always listening, always engaging and deepening his knowledge. He knows what forces influence the prices, what events affect them. A good merchant listens to rumours and gossips spread by travelers at inns and taverns; hoping for a clue, a hint where to go, where a good deal awaits. A good merchant surrounds himself with specialists smarter than him, people who help him maximize profits and minimize losses. He always expands his fleet of carts, he balances risks, calculates profitability. The conditions are constantly changing, and supply and demand for different goods with them. Maybe you\'d like to pay a cheaper price for furs in the summer, and sell them for a hefty profit as the winter is coming and people need warmth. But is it worth carrying them for so many days, risking robbery, moths and taking precious space that you could use to transport something now and make a profit immediately? Or is it worth to buy illegal herb in the out of reach swamps where it cost\'s next to nothing, and risk smuggling it into the city where you can sell it for an amazing profit? But what if the city guards want to control you? Should you pay a bribe? How big? Maybe the best course of action is to  say that you have nothing and hope they don\'t find anything? These are the types of questions you will have to ask yourself constantly.  Merchants of Kaidan has 4 story lines each with many quests. Main quest that brings you closer to avenging your father\'s murder, and 3 side-quest lines. A total of over 100 quests each composed of multiple steps. A set of random events that influence your journeys. A storm on the sea, attack by dragons, highway robbery and many, many more. Three types of transport of your goods: by roads, by sea and by flight, each has its advantages and disadvantages and a unique set of events associated. As you grow your fleet you can join a partnership and you\'ll get to manage 3 traders. You can hire advisers each specializing in a different field. Their council will help you in a variety of issues. Some will show you shortcuts on the roads, some will help you fight of the bandits, some will council you on how to sail better and in case of a storm, how to minimize risks and losses. If you wish, you can also send them to school to improve their abilities for additional cost. 4 seasons of the year that influence the prices of goods, open some paths for travel and block the others. They also impact the way the game looks, each city has a distinct look at different time of the year. Random blessings and curses that influence your statistics. They in turn affect how well you conduct business. A set of artifacts that influence your statistics or can help negate the effects of random events. A complex market fluctuation algorithm that include many variables such as: demand, supply, seasons of the year, localization of the city, random events like droughts or rat infestation.

You were finally a grown-up, able to take care of yourself, a person worthy of continuing your fathers\' legacy. He wasn\'t born into money. To buy his first cart, he had to work very hard saving every silver and copper. One trade after trade, step after step, he climbed the ladder, transforming his tiny one-man venture into a trading company of a rather significant size. Then he met Van Talodd, the most famous merchant in the whole kingdom, and soon enough he entered into partnership. This enterprise proved very profitable, and Van Talodd promised your father something more precious than wealth. A lordship. Few weeks ago he left to the Capital � Ovoros � to accept the title. He was taking a little longer to come back than you expected, but recent weather was unfavourable, maybe he got stuck, or a road turned into a swamp... it happened all the time. It was almost dusk when you heard the knocking to the door. A messenger, his clothes soiled with mud, brought you a letter. There was no lordship, your father was found a traitor, an enemy of the Kingdom, and hanged for conspiring against the king, after a very hasty trial. All his assets and estate confiscated and handed over to the person who exposed the entire plot � Van Talodd. Suddenly everything became crystal clear, Van Talodd maimed him with promises of lordship, the only thing money can\'t buy. But his real purpose was to entrap your father and take over his fortune. Instead of your birthday present, you got carts full of kings\' sell-swords approaching quickly. There was no time to loose, you had to run fast and far. Flee from the men that were certainly sent to kill you. That is only a beginning of your story, you\'re left with only your family ring that you had on you.  Take a fake name you need to avenge your father. Follow the same path as him, grow rich and destroy Van Talodd. The road there is hard and long � are you strong enough to make it?  Kaidan is a fictitious world, that was once a home to a space-faring civilization. It\'s history is almost unknown. Only that, once they developed starships, they relatively quickly left the planet.

It focuses on being distraction-free, simple, and fully customizable. Principles We built Nimble Writer with a couple principles in mind to make it stand out as a primary application for authors: Writing without distractions or worrying about formatting. Stay more organized with many useful organizational features. Materials of reference (such as photos, drawings, scribbles of text, character information, and much more) are available at your fingertips. Don\'t have any limitations to the default array of features. This means full customization, with a fully customizable and scriptable interface. Turn off features you don\'t need, change the entire look and feel of your writing environment, and much more. If you are used to writing stories in applications such as Word or other regular office tools, you\'ll find that Nimble Writer will be able to help you organize bundles of stories and notes together much simpler and faster. In addition, Nimble Writer is able to import some of those old documents and convert them into the Nimble Writer format. Advantages over traditional software Traditional writing software such as Word, Open Office or Google Docs are made just for the purpose of writing, so they don\'t have anything that helps story writers manage their notes and reference material, and neither does it offer much customization. They don\'t have any kind of chapter management either. Nimble Writer has all of those things, making it a much more productive choice for story writing. Steam\'s advantages With Nimble Writer\'s presence on Steam we can use the power that Steam\'s platform brings us, such as Steam Cloud . This means that you will be able to save your stories and notes entirely on Steam\'s cloud servers, so that you can load up your stories on another computer as well, just as easy! Don\'t forget about Steam Workshop ! With the implementation of the Workshop, you\'ll be able to share interface themes and addons with the world, or just to customize the app with other people\'s addons! Share creativity!'),

One of the biggest challenges we had while making the game is stopping the player from button mashing. When our friends play tested our game they�d instinctively button mash, they couldn�t help themselves. It must have been the many years of playing other brawlers that engraved it in their minds the notion of rapidly pressing buttons to kill your foes. The game�s designed in such a way that if you button mash, you die. Every press matters. Although playing the game should still be simple, you see a bad guy in front of you, you attack him, he dies. If you punch even once when there�s no enemy in front of you, you�re going to miss. If you miss, chances are you�re going to get hit. It�s a simple system but it�s ruthless to button mashers.

CRIMENET � The dynamic contract database lets gamers pick and choose from available jobs by connecting with local contacts such as Vlad the Ukrainian, shady politician \"The Elephant\", and South American drug trafficker Hector, all with their own agenda and best interests in mind. PAYDAY Gun Play and Mechanics on a New Level � Firing weapons and zip tying civilians never felt so good. Dynamic Scenarios � No heist ever plays out the same way twice. Every single scenario has random geometry or even rare events. Choose Your Skills � As players progress they can invest in any of five special Skill Trees: Mastermind, Enforcer, Ghost, Technician and Fugitive. Each features a deep customization tree of associated skills and equipment to master, and they can be mixed and matched to create the ultimate heister. More Masks than Ever � PAYDAY 2 features a completely new mask system, giving players the ability to craft their own unique mask together with a pattern and a color combination, resulting in millions of different combinations. Weapons and Modifications � A brand new arsenal for the serious heister, covering everything from sniper and assault rifles to compact PDWs and SMGs. Once you\'ve settled for a favorite, you can modify it with optics, suppressors, fore grips, reticles, barrels, frames, stocks and more, all of which will affect the performance of your weapon. There are also purely aesthetic enhancements - why not go for the drug lord look with polished walnut grips for your nine? Play It Your Way � Each job allows for multiple approaches, such as slow and stealthy ambushes, to running in guns blazing. Hit the target any way you want, and watch as the heist unfolds accordingly. New Game Content All the Time � More than 70 updates since release and still going strong with new heists, characters, weapons and other gameplay features like driving cars and forklifts. Every month offers new free content and paid DLC as PAYDAY 2 continues to be developed by the OVERKILL crew until at least 2017. '),

Take up arms and drop into intense infantry, vehicle, and air combat. Players come together in enormous battles across four massive continents to win control of critical territories, gaining key resources for their empire. With an extensive skill tree and class-based system, players can customize their soldier, weapons, and vehicles to match their playstyle and meet the needs of their squads, outfits, and empires. In the world of PlanetSide 2, every soldier makes a difference.   THREE WARRING EMPIRES: Players will choose to align with one of three empires: the militaristic, authoritarian Terran Republic; the rebellious, freedom-fighting New Conglomerate; or the technocratic, alien-influenced Vanu Sovereignty. Each empire has access to empire-specific weapons, attachments, vehicles, abilities, and more.  MASSIVE WARFARE: Battles take place not between dozens of soldiers, but between hundreds. They fight on foot. They pile into vehicles. They take to the skies in devastating aircraft. Each battleground holds valuable resources and strategic positions, and the empire that can conquer and hold these territories will be rewarded with the resources and the means to achieve victory.  ENORMOUS MAPS: PlanetSide 2 features four incredible and diverse continent maps with dozens of square kilometers of seamless gameplay space, every inch of which is hand-crafted and contestable. Whether in open fields, barren desert, in armed and armored bases, or in the skies, victory will rely on knowing your surroundings.  PERSISTENCE THAT PAYS: In PlanetSide 2 the war isn�t won by a single base capture. The core gameplay of PlanetSide 2 is about holding crucial territories and controlling resources. Working strategically as a team to secure tactical positions has long-lasting effects that can shift the tide of battle.  CLASS-BASED COMBAT: Players can build their soldier to match wants and their allies\' needs. Six distinct classes provide a wealth of squad options and combat tactics. Grow your soldier over time as you master each combat role, weapon, and vehicle, laterally unlocking hundreds of weapons, attachments, gear, skills, vehicles, and more. Heavy Assault: Rush into the battle guns blazing. You are the dedicated foot soldier of Auraxis. Light Assault: Go where the Heavies can�t with your short-burst jetpack. Pick a high spot, throw a grenade, and out maneuver your foes! Combat Medic: Keep your fellow soldiers alive and in fighting shape. You are the beating heart of any squad. Infiltrator: Stay silent. Stay invisible. You are death from the shadows, whether with a knife from behind or a single shot from a sniper\'s nest. You are the enemy\'s constant fear. Engineer: Deploy crucial equipment. Resupply your allies. Fix the thing, then fix it again. You keep the machines running, the tanks firing, and the war effort moving forward. MAX: Step into your Mechanized Assault Exo-Suit (MAX). Cannons for hands, armor for flesh, and a disposition to match, you are a walking mass of nigh unstoppable death.  OUTFIT TEAMWORK: Join or form your own Outfit, a like-minded group of soldiers who train together day in and day out. Whether a small rapid response team or a massive clan, Outfits are vital to each empire\'s strategic organization.  VEHICLES & WEAPONS: Train and equip your solider how you want, with a huge array of weapons and vehicles which can be extensively customized by preference or purpose, using attachments, upgrades, and add-ons earned in the war.  PLAY FOR FREE: PlanetSide 2 is free to play with optional in-game purchases. '),

Farm management, cultivating fields, planting crops, animal husbandry and buying and selling produce are just a few of the major game elements this simulator offers. Starting out with a small estate, the player begins their career as an up-and-coming farmer and little by little acquires new fields, tractors, machines and animals, and can either specialize or make use of all options that farming has to offer. The key to success lies in good planning by season, expert knowledge that you acquire throughout the game, and skill and good old-fashioned hard work. As a farmer, the player learns to live with the forces of nature, accept the weather and respond so as to perfect the yield from fields, care for the animals and prepare the budget for new investments. Many tractors and farm machines (combine harvesters, field choppers, attaching parts and trailers, etc.) by renowned manufacturers are available to cultivate the farm and manage all the work.  Only good planning and hard work will turn fallow earth into a flourishing and fertile soil. Of course, you can drive and control all machines yourself, be it hooking up the plough, re-filling the tractor or unloading the harvest. \"Professional Farmer 2014\" has a broad variety of crops, depending on the environment and climate, with which the farmer can cultivate the fields diversely, effectively and with a high yield. Even crop rotation plays an important role in planning! The integrated seasons influence the game and provide the player with a constant stream of tasks and jobs. The local farmers market is your first stepping-stone to success! After just a short time, you should take our home grown and harvested produce to the market and earn your first money by selling it. As you sell more, you will soon see more and larger machines in your fleet and be able to grow larger quantities of produce. Gradually, you will even be able to construct new buildings and acquire new fields. Features For the first time ever in a farming simulator: Different seasons and yearly planning Countless original tractors Campaign mode contains a plethora of missions for hours of engrossing fun.

In battle, Zetterburn uses no weapons except for his razor-sharp claws and ability to control flame. BURN DAMAGE - Zetterburn\'s special attacks can set opponents on fire, causing them additional damage over time. WILD FIRE - Zetterburn\'s Down Special places flames on the stage. These flames stay for a period of time, burning any opponents who come in contact with them. FIRE AMP - When an opponent is burning, Zetterburn\'s Strong Attacks can absorb the flames and launch the burned enemy twice as far, making for an effective killing blow. Orcane is a playful trickster, notorious for escaping even the most precarious of situations. He can transform into water and confuse enemies with a spray of bubbles. PUDDLE TELEPORTATION - Orcane creates a puddle with his Neutral Special or Down Special. He can then teleport to his puddle using his Up Special as a powerful vertical blow or an effective recovery when launched off the stage. BUBBLE EVAPORATION - Orcane can turn his puddle into a pillar of bubbles with his Down Special to trap enemies above the puddle. WATER AMP - When standing on top of his puddle, Orcane can consume the water underneath him to perform powerful Strong Attacks with far greater range and knockback. The youngest trainee in the history of the Air Academy, Wrastor has never lived by anyone\'s rules but his own. Currently an Aerial Ace for the Air Armada, Wrastor is wrecking havoc among the Armada\'s enemies and generals alike. WINGED FLIGHT - Wrastor can jump 4 times, making him incredible at controlling the air and recovering from the toughest falls even when things look grim. WIND CURRENT - Wrastor can create a Wind Current with his Forward Special, allowing him to move faster within it and chase his targets more effectively. AERIAL ACE - Wrastor performs his charged Strong Attacks in the air instead of on the ground, a first for this genre. Kragg is a defender of the colossal Aetherian Forest. Deliberate and loyal, he is one of the infamous Wall Runners who patrol the Rock Wall. Unlike other Wall Runners, Kragg has the legendary ability to control the earth with his will. ROCK HURL - Kragg can pull a rock out of the ground and hurl it at opponents. After it leaves his hands, the rock becomes a solid piece of stage that either Kragg or other players can break. DEFENSE BALL - Kragg can curl into a ball and roll toward enemies. Although he can be damaged while in ball form, he cannot be knocked away. EARTH PILLAR - Kragg can summon a pillar of earth to his feet regardless of where he is. If Kragg is about to fall to his death, this move can quickly turn his situation around. Forsburn is the disgraced, eldest son of the Firelands\' ruling family. After being condemned by the Fire Council and his own brother, Forsburn found refuge in a group of outsiders who had rejected the flame and mastered the way of smoke. SMOKE SCREEN - Forsburn can use his Neutral Special to obscure the battlefield allowing Forsburn to remain hidden inside a cloud of smoke. DECOY - Through his Forward Special, Forsburn can create a smoke facsimile of himself that can attack opponents. The illusory Forsburn breaks into smoke after being hit by a single attack. CONSUME/COMBUST - By using his Down Special, Forsburn can consume his smoke clouds back into his body. After consuming three clouds, Forsburn is charged up and can use Down Special again to combust: knocking opponents away at high speed. Maypul is the self-appointed Guardian of the Aetherian Forest. She commands fearful respect throughout the forest for her unhesitating vigilantism. She uses her agility to trap any unknown intruders before they even realize she is there. WATCHER\'S MARK - Maypul can use her Seeds or her Watcher\'s Dash to mark opponents, making them susceptible to her following attacks. WRAPPED UP - After marking her targets, Maypul can use her Strong Attacks or her trusty Plant to wrap marked opponents in place allowing her to follow up with another attack. SLING SHOT - Maypul can use her vines to sling toward marked opponents, allowing her to elude attacks and quickly close distances. Absa is a famed engineer and martialist of the Elders of the Air Alliance. Despite the laws of the Elders, Absa secretly developed storm techniques in the caves of the Archai mountains. CLOUD CONTROL - Absa can place a cloud using her Neutral or Forward Special. This cloud hangs in the air until Absa bursts it by tapping her Neutral Special and knocking enemies away. THUNDER BOLT - Absa can charge her Neutral Special to create a powerful lightning blast that connects her to her cloud. All opponents caught between the two will be knocked away at high speeds. CONDENSED STORM - Absa focuses the power of a lightning bolt to the tip of her hoof. If she can line up one of her aerial kicks perfectly, she unleashes great power. Etalus is a legendary warrior in his native land. He is one of the last surviving members of the Harbor Guard and uses the power of ice to augment his massive strength. HOME ICE ADVANTAGE: Etalus can use his Forward Special or Forward Tilt to freeze the ground beneath him in order to slide across on the icy surface. ARMORED UP: When standing on ice, Etalus can use his Neutral Special to absorb the ice and create ice armor around his body. AVALANCHE: Etalus can use his Down Special to shatter all nearby ice, instantly freezing any enemies who are standing on it. '),

Players choose from 6 distinct robot characters of varying personality, ability, and weaponry, forming two teams of 3 robots. Players must work with their teammates to attack enemy robots until they are turned into bins of scrap, then transport the bins back to their base as scraps for recycling. It�s capture-the-flag where the players are the flags! Once a team has collected enough scraps, they can create the mighty giant robot, El Rey Gigante Robo Jr., and unleash him to destroy the enemy base and win! THE STORY After years of making a mess of things, mankind has finally given up and left Earth to find a new planet to trash. Left behind were the machines that once dutifully served their human masters. Among these were the robots of arch-rival companies Robotic Engineering Depot (RED) and Blucom Discarded Plastics and Metals. With nothing else to do, these now-leaderless robots escalated their competition into fierce combat. Both sides are now desperately collecting materials to create a giant robot powerful enough to destroy the other. The RUSTBUCKET RUMBLE has begun! ROBOT CLASSES Clancy Grunt Model CLN-C has probably taken one too many hits, bullets, and rockets to the head, but he never gives up. Always helpful, Clancy is quick to heal teammates or provide cover fire from his automatic rifle. He doesn�t have any fancy gadgets to carry scraps, because he doesn�t need them. All Clancy needs to retrieve scraps is just some good old fashion determination and his metal robot arms. Daisy Engineer Model QT-3.14 has a cute and cheerful appearance, but make no mistake � Daisy is a technician of pain and punishment. Small in stature, she commands a powerful mech suit to help her build sentry turrets and carry drones. And she�s happy to get into the fray with her roller bomb launcher. Kasumi Ninja Model KA5-M13 was originally built for non-combat purposes. After the humans left, she finally got to pursue her dream of being a ninja assassin, but with a modern twist. Holograms, smoke bombs, and a cyber sword help her quickly dismantle enemies before they even know what happened. Bjorn Brute Model HPM4X has an imposing stature and makes the most of it. Running head first into danger, he uses his powerful flamethrower to decimate enemies. His energy shield keeps him alive even in the worst conditions, and he�s so strong that he can easily toss scraps to his teammates. Valentina Sniper Model H0RN3T is as calm as she is deadly. Cold and calculating, she finds that the best place to position herself during combat is just out of sight from her foes. After dropping an enemy, she uses her extending grabber claw to retrieve scraps from afar. Even if her opponents do get the jump on her, she never loses her cool and uses stun grenades and a short range rapid-fire pistol to hold them off. Maverick Bombardier Model DNGR-Z0N is a show-off. Thinking his jetpack puts him above the competition, he�s developed a cocky, prideful demeanor. His jetpack allows him to maneuver in and out of combat with ease and perform bombing runs. If he�s not careful, then Maverick may find himself in dangerous situations. But little do his foes know, that�s right where he wants to be. The danger zone. And when it seems like Maverick has bitten off more than he can chew; he uses his trusty rocket launcher to help even the odds. He can fly, get a burst of speed, and drop a number of bombs to the unfortunate robots below.'),

Secret Ponchos is a beautiful but deadly competitive PvP fighting game set in a stylish Spaghetti Western universe. The isometric gameplay is team based and unlike any fighting game or MOBA you\'ve played before. Combat is fast-paced, precise and merciless, resulting in a competitive environment where skills matter. There is no auto-attacking or hand-holding � every shot is a skill-shot!  Surviving in the Wild West will not be easy. You�ll be squaring off against the deadliest outlaws in 3v3 shootouts and 1v1 duels. It�s your ability to out maneuver your opponent (range control, timing, accuracy), your cunning team play, and your strategic use of the environment that will determine whether you collect the bounty on your enemies heads or they collect yours.  The �Most Wanted Edition� brings a heavily expanded version of Secret Ponchos to Steam. Switchblade Monkeys, the indie developers behind Secret Ponchos (that�s us!), are a small group of friends that have been building Secret Ponchos from their homes for the last 6 years. They worked closely over this last year with the Early Access community to refine features, and add more than double the game�s content (including an enhanced character roster, new maps, and all-new game modes) and are now proud to present the official release. \"The Most Wanted Edition\" of Secret Ponchos was showcased at EVO 2015 this year, and received an incredibly strong reception from the competitive community.  From the fighting game community... \"Played this game at EVO and had to come back for more. Fast-paced, strategic, and fresh game-play, it\'s a blast to play and even more fun to win.\" - Skisonic, EVO Commentator \"Secret Ponchos is that sleeper OP game that I think everyone needs in their Steam library ASAP\" - TKbreezy, Smash Commentator EVERY SHOT IS A SKILL SHOT!! Think you\'re good at PVP?  Skill shots mean you actually have to land the shot using yourself, by using accuracy, good spacing, and timing. There is no auto attack or aim locking to hold your hand. Secret Ponchos is a game where you can only rely on your gameplay skills, reflexes, timing, and precision.  Secret Ponchos was not built as a MOBA, but as a fighting game that supports fast paced team combat. Team play is an amazing fit with a fighting game. Form a Spaghetti Western gang of different outlaw classes, and enter the street to gun down your rivals  in an intense shootout.  Depth of combat: everything has a cost. While new players may simply run and gun at first, the deeper layers of combat create room for a skilled outlaw to control the fight. There are a large variety of attacks, but every choice and every action has a cost. Evading may get you into position quickly but costs stamina which you might have needed to escape. Every bullet matters since you have to manually reload. A heavy attack leaves you open for counter fire if you miss. To survive you need to be able to think under pressure. Key Features 10 Unique Outlaws: Each outlaw brings a unique gameplay style, weapons, and advantages for your team. They all carry a lot of depth, and play as different as they look. Line of Sight: Take cover behind the environment to break line-of-sight between you and your enemies. When taking cover you will disappear from an enemies� view, allowing you to ambush, flank, or take a moment to regroup. Line of site and cover mechanics bring the environment into the shootout. Combat Modes: A fighting game that supports gang vs gang combat, setting it apart from the fighting game genre. It also includes traditional 1v1 standoffs for more intimate battles. AI bots & Arcade Mode: Arcade mode is a simple tournament against a roster of AI opponents (1v1). A great way to get comfortable with your Outlaw of choice. Add bots to your online matches (Unranked mode only) to refine your skills. Gain notoriety and level up your outlaw. Unlock perks, skins, and reputation classes as the bounty on your own head rises. Seasonal Leaderboards to see who is the most wanted.

Shoppe Keep challenges you to shrewdly set the price of each item and watch the money roll in � but if your stock is too expensive, you will find your supplies shrinking as stealing increases! Stop Thieves quickly, with a swing of your sword or a zap of a lightning spell! (Or maybe both, if you�re really bloodthirsty.) Price your wares competitively and great adventurers will travel from miles away to your one-stop shop to spend their gold � the gold that they probably found conveniently placed on a cave floor! Shoppe Keep delivers deep gameplay mechanics in a memorable, tongue-in-cheek world. Gone are the days of testing the theoretical water � we�re now a fully-fledged, fully-opened store! We even have an inn! This building has been blocked off for some time, and many have speculated that it will be an Inn � well, the sneaky players were right! The Inn is best used at lower levels and a lower gold count. For a small amount of kPoints, you are able to unlock the Inn with a single table for four guests. An inn with a single table? What complete rubbish! Additional tables can be purchased by speaking with the innkeeper, as well as additional upgrades that will help your Inn deliver serious coin. Adventurers traveling through town might want to visit the Inn and enjoy some food and ale � if they haven�t found some randomly laying around on their travels already. We all know that fantasy worlds cater for their heroes � but with Shoppe Keep, you�ll be able to make sure that catering doesn�t equal �potato in a toilet�! Various members of four completely original and never before seen character classes will visit your store, including hardened warriors, magical mages, sneaky rogues and wise druids. (As you can tell, we�re taking this description text VERY seriously!) Each of these character types will seek to purchase items relating to their unique skill set - a warrior will be hard-pressed to take a flimsy magical robe into close quarters� battle, for instance! Mages, however, will be perfectly happy with a wooden stick. It�s �magical�, or something ridiculous those absurd mages believe. Will you be able to accommodate for all four classes of customers? You have a completely unreasonable clientele to add pressure to your role as a Shoppe Keeper. After a day of heroism, beating up goblins and even battling the great ol� Dragonclaw, your customers can be just a little short-fused. This means your displays can be spoilt and your tables may be damaged by angry customers! The renegade �heroes� are not too worried about bringing in dirt from the street either! However, help is at hand! As the owner of the store you�ll be armed with various exciting tools for combating these issues. The mighty wooden broomstick will sweep away dirt brought in from your customers, and the great hammer will repair furniture damaged by these �extraordinary� visitors. A few sweeps and a couple of swings means that your shop will be in tip-top shape. Grow your business, and you can employ an army of �Helper Bots� to take care of this for you � the cutting edge in imaginary technology that totally exists. Set your prices too high and your customers may think twice about investing their hard won (or stolen) gold in your shop. They�ll take the plunge and attempt to steal stock right under your nose! With no CCTV available in ye olde world of Shoppe Keep, you have to rely on your combat skill! A sharp swing of the sword or the zap of a magic spell can make quick work of these pesky Thieves. But be cautious not to hit any innocent bystanders or you�ll suffer a monetary penalty, as well as a life riddled with guilt! Not to mention the hideous moral conundrum of whether or not to tell your family or- look, just don�t kill innocent people. And let�s not forget the ferocious Barbarians! They live on the outskirts of the city, looming like an ancient race of organic-synthetic hybrids that invade the gal- wait, wrong game. Regularly invading the town, Barbarians will cause as much damage and destruction as possible! They will even fight you directly if you try to stop them. Eliminate a few dozen Barbarians and they�ll invite a much� larger friend to come and visit you. But what will you do with all the bodies? Unless you wish to display the corpses as examples to your customers, you monster, you�ll need to use either the broomstick or the grinder. It�s tough running a shop (especially one that may or may not be the venue of a murder-fest); there are not enough hours in the day to go out and procure new items for yourself. Thankfully, you can employ a Champion, unlocked via the skill tree. Select a class, equip the Champion with your finest armour and weapons, and send them out to bring home rare new wares. Despite that awful half-rhyme, some of these items can be sold, some are junk and others can be crafted into more powerful gear. Your Champion will need to gain experience, just like the fantasy heroes you�re familiar with. During their first outing, they may fall in battle (and regret not saving more recently!), and whilst they will not return with any new goods, the experience will have taught them valuable skills that will improve their chances next time. �Helper Bots� are your robotic staff team. The MK III charts the latest iteration of this tech, increasing the artificial intelligence of this mechanical chap. We all knew that true AI technology would be created before CCTV � it was inevitable. The �Helper Bot� has three duties; zapping Thieves who attempt to steal from your shop, picking up items that customers may have thrown to the floor, and restocking items back on the shelves.

For example: you will often need to use your map to plan your moves in open levels, and health does not magically regenerate. Don\'t worry though, agents are a dime a dozen. As long as you still have an agent alive, you can call in reinforcements to replace those unlucky ones that had too much lead for breakfast. The radio is where the signal in Signal Ops comes from. Since you are sitting comfortably back at base commanding your agents in the field, you\'ll need to position radio equipment in order to keep in contact with them. BOLT : Your electronics expert who acts as the center of your field operations. WRENCH : A mechanical specialist for sneaky entrances. SPY : A master of disguise who\'s art of conversation can turn the tides. SCOPE : A skilled marksman and infiltrator. SHIELD : The combat specialist who\'s got your back.

Slip is not for the faint of heart. It has an immense focus on timing and features devilishly tricky level design. Utilizing your two colors, absorb damage from incoming projectiles of the same color, or be destroyed immediately by the opposite color. Additionally, Slip features colored Geometry that you only interact with when you share its color. This is perfect when you need a place to stand, but can result in instant death if you land on a set of spikes sharing your color. In addition to color based obstacles, Slip is also host to numerous Color driven props. Sharing the color of a launch-ring will shoot you in the direction it faces. Match the color of a gravity well to get sucked in and color swap again to have it launch you in which ever direction you are spinning. Lastly, utilize the phase shift platforms to shift vertically in the direction of your color. Game Progression: Slip is split up into 12 levels with an overworld connecting them. Game progression is linear with each level being unlocked when the level before it is beaten. Each level features a plethora of deadly obstacles that result in instant death. However, since the game can be quite difficult, there are frequent checkpoints laid throughout each level. Lives are NOT limited. You can press on until your thumbs are weary. At the end of every level there is a mini-boss or boss encounter. During these sequences the game switches to an autorun mode where the player can adjust their position on screen by moving left or right. Here, positioning can mean the difference between life and death. Why we run: The story of Slip. You play as the devilishly cubie protagonist. You\'ve always been pretty awesome with your ability to swap between 2 colors. You\'re a pretty sweet deal. Your nemesis Steve, on the other hand, is gross and smooth, nasty and organic. His color is that of a sickly peach. Why doesn\'t he just swap colors like you? Because he can\'t. Because he\'s Steve. In his early years Steve idolized you. He wanted to be you. After a failed attempt to become your sidekick (you don\'t have sidekicks since you\'re not a superhero) Steve began to seclude himself from the world. His envy of you grew and turned to hatred and resentment. He worked tirelessly in his lab creating all forms of horrible beings. His greatest triumph however has just been unleashed upon you. You couldn\'t have foreseen in your wildest dreams that Steve\'s malice would lead to such a monstrosity as the color purple. And now, it is upon you. Key Features Steam Leaderboards: Keep track of your rank in every level of Slip. (PC only. The Mac version does not have Steamworks support) Challenge Levels: In addition to the core game levels, there are also 20 challenge levels that really put your platforming skills to the test. Controller Support: Enjoy Slip from the couch. (PC only. Mac versions of Slip do not have controller support) Accessory Unlocks - To add a bit of silly to a light hearted game, players can also unlock clothing accessories to wear while playing. These accessories are unlocked by feats of skill while playing. The requirements can range from beating the first level to completing a level without dying. 3 Difficulty Levels - Even though Slip is immensely difficult (in a fair sort of way) players will find that their skill level increases dramatically as they master the art of color swapping. As such, there are 3 levels of play. Normal - 100% gamespeed. Hard - 110% gamespeed. And Sassy - 120% gamespeed. These percentages might not sound intimidating, but they are really quite dramatic in the context of Slip '),

Unlike traditional animation which requires each frame to be hand-drawn, Spriter animations are made of individual sprite pieces ; these pieces can be rotated, transformed, and tweened along an animation timeline. This allows you to quickly create great looking animations in a fraction of the time while requiring significantly less art. Spriter also takes advantage of skeletal animation . Create a skeleton using the bone tool, attach images to each bone, and finally animate the bones with Spriter\'s vast array of user-friendly animation tools. The result: a fully animated sprite using your own graphics. Spriter is great for animating characters, user interfaces, power-ups, combat animations and more! Even if you\'ve never animated before, Spriter provides you with an easy to understand, yet powerful toolset allowing you to jump right in! Spriter Pro includes the Essentials versions of all of our Animated Art Packs, free to use in any of your game projects. Once you install Spriter Pro It they will be located in the following location: /SteamApps/common/Spriter/Art Packs/Essentials Key Features: Using keyframes you can quickly lay out major frame changes. Frames in-between the keyframes are then automatically created. You can then edit individual frames as desired to make your animations really shine. Animations can be exported as spritesheets, animated GIF files, sequential images and more. Reuse your previous animations by incorporating them in new ones. Create perfect, smooth transitions and varieties that save time by working with animations you\'ve already created. Adjust animation easing with several curve settings to help make your animations more lifelike. Create pixel perfect retro style animations with Pixel Art Mode. Spawn bullets, particle effects, or anything that requires precise locations and angles. Set up guide lines and load in background images to work on top of. Seperate characters into important collision areas. Inverse Kinematics. Change a bone\'s parent, add or remove bones, or even change sprite pieces mid-animation. Import sound effects and even use lip-syncing with built-in Papagayo support. Use Animation Data Directly In Your Game: Animations are recreated in real-time using the sprite piece images just like in Spriter. Animations are much smoother and require drastically less memory as compared to sprite-sheets. Manipulate animations via game events. Reuse your animation data for completely new characters or character customizations. Perfect for characters who gain new clothing, equipment etc. Spriter animations can be imported with full feature support in Unity and Construct 2.  There are also free, open source, fully featured reference implementations for using Spriter files in C#, C++, JavaScript, and MonoGame.

Even people who have no history of seizures or epilepsy may have an undiagnosed condition that can cause these \"photosensitive epileptic seizures\" while watching video games. These seizures may have a variety of symptoms, including lightheadedness, altered vision, eye or face twitching, jerking or shaking of arms or legs, disorientation, confusion, or momentary loss of awareness. Seizures may also cause loss of consciousness or convulsions that can lead to injury from falling down or striking nearby objects. Immediately stop playing and consult a doctor if you experience any of these symptoms. Parents should watch for or ask their children about the above symptoms - children and teenagers are more likely than adults to experience these seizures.

Help a small group of settlers build a home for themselves in a forgotten land. You�ll need to establish a food supply, build shelter, defend your people, monitor their moods, and find a way to grow and expand, facing challenges at every step. Starting from procedurally generated terrain with dynamic AI encounters, Stonehearth combines community management and combat with infinite building possibilities. It�s designed to be moddable at every level, from your city to the people and creatures inhabiting the world, and will ship with the tools and documentation for you to add your own customizations to the game, and share them with friends. Build and Grow Your City The heart of the game is city building and management. When you\'re just starting out, you\'ll need to juggle tasks like obtaining a sustainable food supply, building shelter, and defending your fledgling settlement from raiders and other threats. Once you\'ve achieved a foothold in the world, it\'s up to you to write the destiny for your people. You have the flexibility to choose your own path in this game. Do you want to build a great conquering empire? A vibrant trade city? A spiritual monastery? We really want you to feel like this is your settlement, and give you the tools that make it look and operate exactly as you wish. Level Up Your Settlers All the settlers in your towns have jobs. A job is like a class in a role playing game. Each job has a specific role like hauling materials, building, crafting, and fighting. As your hearthlings work at a job they will gain experience and levels. Some jobs, when they meet certain prerequisites, can upgrade to entirely new jobs with new capabilities. Usually, to assign someone a new job you\'ll also need to craft a tool for them. The Mason can craft blocks, statues, and tools from stone, but to do it he\'ll need a mallet and chisel crafted by the carpenter. Our goal is to have a job tree that\'s both very wide and very deep, so there will be plenty of different kinds of things to do in the game, but also a lot of depth to explore if you want to concentrate on any one area. Player Driven Legacy Through Modding We LOVE mods and want to make it as easy as possible to author and share mods. Want to see a new kind of sword in the game? You can model it, define its stats, and then craft it in game. You can also share the design with other players so they can enjoy it too, or bring their authored content into your game. As a modder you�ll be able to do basically anything that we as developers can do: introduce new items and monsters, write new scripted adventures, influence the AI, you name it. It goes back to that original pen and paper RPG experience, where �the game� is a collaboration between the core ruleset and the stories crafted by the gamemaster.'),

Start your career as an Intergalactic miner on a randomly generated infinite world in search of profit and glory in Campaign, sit back and build to your hearts content in Creative mode or pit your Techs against the clock and dare to run the Gauntlet Challenge. There are many game modes available in TerraTech to stretch your Tech building imagination to the limits! Story In the distant future, Earth\'s natural resources have been depleted, and as a resource-gathering prospector it\'s your job to travel to alien planets and scour them for valuable materials. But you are not alone! Rival prospectors litter the landscapes of these new worlds, and will fight to protect what�s theirs, and invade to take what�s yours. To make your mark, you will need to be cunning and creative. Using the building blocks, guns, wheels, and wings from several Mining Corporations, you can build varied Techs to suit every purpose. Be it powerful armoured combat vehicles, unstoppable resource gathering machines, sprawling resource processing bases or a hybrid of all three - creativity is your key to exo-planetary success. The worlds in TerraTech are procedurally generated and infinite, so there are always new lands to discover and more resources to find. Treacherous mountain ranges, luscious grasslands and huge deserts are among the biomes you will encounter. More will be added as development progresses. The intergalactic mining industry is a profitable one, but you are not the only miner in search for new worlds to exploit. Defending yourself from rival miners will take time, resources and skill, with success leading to new territory and new lands. All equipable blocks and items can be damaged or destroyed, so ensuring you are sufficiently armed and ready for battle is a key element of both survival and prosperity in TerraTech. Get out there and show them who�s boss! By gathering and processing natural resources, players are able to construct storage, refining and construction bases in order to craft new blocks in the game. Like the look of that Venture Hail Fire Rifle that just tore your vehicle apart? Go prospecting for the needed resources, and craft a couple for yourself in the shiny new Venture fabricator which you just aquired, by beating their time trial challenge in the nearby mountains. All exo-planetary miners buy parts from the established Mining Corporations, which each have their own specific brand of mining technology. Get the job done with GSO, zoom around with high-performance recon specialists Venture, strip-mine to the max with the heavy-duty GeoCorp or act with miltary efficiency utilizing the stealth focussed Hawkeye. New Corporations we�re aiming to add to the game include deranged experimental scientists Reticule Research, technological superiority giants Better Future and the hive-mind AI swarms of LEGION.

Set at a skyscraper construction site, the game�s goal is to climb ever higher and higher. The game is all about physics and interaction with the environment. Character Mr. Bobley is just your average construction worker who arrives to work in the morning only to find intricate puzzles to solve. He has to prove his skills in a hazardous construction site environment. To advance in the game he has to figure out how to use various kinds of construction machinery to his advantage. Game mechanics While the game looks almost like a 2d platformer, the character can walk in any direction. The camera view is locked overlooking the scene at a constant angle. Even when driving vehicles the camera angle remains unchanged. To aid the player in orienting themselves in 3d space, small graphical help is provided in the form of a jump distance indicator and a picture-in-picture window. Levels There are 24 levels in the game. Each level has several puzzles that you need to solve in order to advance to the next puzzle. Level design can be quite complex because there are usually multiple floors in one level. Higher floors become transparent to prevent blocking the player�s view. Nonetheless, the player always knows where to go because the exit is always to the right and upwards. This is yet another game mechanic taken from classic platformer games. Puzzles All puzzles are based on physics interaction with the environment. You have to drive cars, trucks, fork-lifts and tipping lorries. Use cranes and elevators to push, haul, lift and transport objects as necessary to overcome challenges and get obstacles out of the way. You also need to build bridges and make stairways. There are also various minigames like maze puzzle, escape run, even a soccer match. '),

If you\'ve been following it or playing it in Early Access, you know what to expect. If you\'ve just discovered it, \"stay awhile and listen\". The most commonly asked question is: What Kind of Game Is It? It�s a very different game than anything you�ve ever played. I�m sure you�ve noticed that the RPG genre hasn�t really been explored yet and most RPGs follow the formula that didn�t change in 20 years. While there were always games that strayed off the beaten path � Darklands, Planescape: Torment, King of Dragon Pass � such games were the exceptions that only reinforced the rule. The Age of Decadence is an experiment, an attempt to explore a different direction, taking you back to the PnP roots of the genre. It doesn�t mean that the game is awesome. In fact, there is a good chance that you won�t like it, precisely because we took too many liberties with the established design. So What Sets The Age of Decadence Apart From Other Games? 1. The Setup Traditionally, many fantasy RPGs are about killing things, clearing up dungeons, and being a hero. There is nothing wrong with mindless fun and wish fulfillment, but we want to offer you something different. To quote Tom Chick (Quarter to Three\'s game critic): \"But Age of Decadence wants nothing to do with kobolds, just as it wants nothing to do with Doo-dads of Unimaginable Power. The overarching idea is a crumbling society divided among three noble Houses, each fumbling around in its own version of darkness to comprehend what destroyed the world. That�s the central mystery. It plays out like noir in that you are the detective, piecing together what really happened from differing accounts, all vividly written with clear voices and efficient prose. And like a detective in a noir yarn, you can�t help but become part of the central mystery, effecting an outcome you might not have intended.\" The Age of Decadence is not a game about killing monsters or exploring mystical lands, but rather, surviving amid the greed and brutality of your fellow humans and carving out a name for yourself. Good and bad are purely relative. It�s a world of scheming and backstabbing in which your words and actions have the potential to forge alliances and sow discord, and your path is never certain. You get to play with seven different factions: three Noble Houses and four \'professional\' guilds: merchants, assassins, thieves, and the army, all fighting for power or influence; over 100 named characters, over 750 �generic� characters with unique IDs taking part in violent take-overs, assassinations, and power grabs, and over 600,000 words of dialogue: a well-developed and thought through world, believable characters, realistic motivations, but no elves, dwarves, magic, and wizards in fashionable, pointy hats. 2. Combat difficulty Another design aspect worth mentioning is combat difficulty. It�s a hard game. Combat difficulty is integrated into the setting. You can�t say that the world is harsh and unforgiving and then let the player kill everyone who looks at him or her funny. The game has to be hard, dying should be easy, and you should have reasons to pick your fights. You aren�t a powerful hero who can defeat anyone and save the world and it is the difficulty that reinforces this notion. Make the game easier and we�re back to the powerful hero setup. So unless you�re a natural born killer, watch what you say and think before you act or you�ll end up dead before you can blink. 3. Choices & Consequences Choices are what the game is all about - crafting your own narrative via a variety of choices that alter the story, playing field, and your options down the road. From multiple quest solutions to branching questlines you\'ll have plenty decisions to make and consequences of said decisions to deal with, which is what makes the game incredibly replayable. Starting the game as a mercenary and joining the Imperial Guards will give a completely different experience, different quests, different content and points of view than, say, playing the game as a merchant (less buying low and selling high, more scheming and plotting to gain advantages for the guild), a praetor serving a Noble House, or an assassin. The questlines are interwoven, forming a large, overarching story, so playing the game only once will be like witnessing events from a single perspective, which is limited by default. You will have to play the game several times to better understand what�s going on, piece everything together, and see the full effect of the choices you make. The Big Question: Should You Buy The Game? Try before you buy. Even if everything I said sounds exactly like your kind of game, try the demo first. That�s what it�s there for. It gives you access to the first Chapter, consisting of 3 locations and about 30 quests split between mutually exclusive questlines and decisions.'),

How much longer will you survive? Welcome to THE LONG DARK , the innovative exploration-survival experience Wired magazine calls \"the pinnacle of an entire genre\". The Long Dark is a thoughtful, exploration-survival experience that challenges solo players to think for themselves as they explore an expansive frozen wilderness in the aftermath of a geomagnetic disaster. There are no zombies -- only you, the cold, and all the threats Mother Nature can muster. The episodic story-mode for The Long Dark, WINTERMUTE, includes two of the five episodes that form its Season One. Both episodes were given a complete overhaul in December 2018, as part of the Redux Update: new mission structure, story beats, dialogue, animations etc. EPISODE ONE - �Do Not Go Gentle� Bush pilot Will Mackenzie (player character) and Dr. Astrid Greenwood are separated after their plane crashes deep in the Northern Canadian wilderness in the aftermath of a mysterious flash of light in the sky. Struggling to survive as he desperately searches for Astrid, Mackenzie comes across the small town of Milton, where he begins to understand the scope of this quiet apocalypse. EPISODE TWO - �LumiNo description availablece Fugue� Mackenzie�s search for Astrid takes him deeper into the savage Winter wilderness. A mysterious trapper may be the key to finding Astrid, but can he be trusted? The first two episodes of WINTERMUTE represent approximately 15 hours of gameplay. Episodes Three to Five are included in the price of the game, and will be unlocked for free as they are released. Features performances by Jennifer Hale, Mark Meer, David Hayter, and Elias Toufexis (Episode Three), and the music of Cris Velasco. Survival Mode is the free-form, non-narrative survival sandbox that has been honed over nearly three years in Early Access. Survival is your only goal, and death your only end. Make your own survival story with every game. NO HAND HOLDING The game challenges players to think for themselves by providing the information but never the answers. You have to earn the right to survive. PERMADEATH When you die in Survival Mode, your save is deleted. Every decision matters. [Note that WINTERMUTE does not feature permadeath. CONDITION & CALORIES Monitor your Hunger, Thirst, Fatigue, and Cold as you struggle to balance resources with the energy needed to obtain them. Every action costs Calories, and time is your most precious resource. Choose your path carefully.

CHOOSE YOUR EXPERIENCE Four distinct Experience Modes let you find a challenge level you are comfortable with, such as Pilgrim Mode, which is meant to be quiet and pensive, all the way to Interloper Mode, where only the most experienced survivors have a chance to last a week. If none of the four Experiences suits you, use Custom Mode settings to tailor your Survival Mode game to your specific tastes. Features the music of Sascha Dikiciyan. Several standalone Challenge Modes offer objective-based experiences designed to last 1-3 hours each, such as Whiteout -- the race to gather enough supplies to prepare for a monster blizzard.

And it needs to be broken. There is one goal. And when you attain it, you die.  Six sisters live in an apartment in the city. One by one their mother sends them on an errand to their grandmother, who is sick and bedridden. The teenagers are instructed to go to grandmother\'s house deep in the forest and, by all means, to stay on the path! Wolves are hiding in the woods, just waiting for little girls to stray. But young women are not exactly known for their obedience, are they? Will they be able to resist the temptations of the forest? Will they stay clear of danger? Can they prevent the ancient tale from being retold?  The Path is a game about growing, about changing, about making choices, about accepting the consequences of these choices. A game about playing, and failing, about embracing life, perhaps by accepting death. Key Features: The Path is a short horror game inspired by older versions of Little Red Riding hood , set in modern day. The Path offers an atmospheric experience of exploration, discovery and introspection through a unique form of gameplay, designed to immerse you deeply into its dark themes. Every interaction in the game expresses an aspect of the narrative. The six protagonists each have their own age and personality and allow the player to live through the tale in different ways. Most of the story, however, relies on your active imagination. The Path is designed with accessibility in mind. There are no ticking clocks or monsters to defeat. No hard puzzles will ever halt your progress. Most activities in the game are entirely optional and voluntary. The player has all the freedom in the world to explore and experience.  While The Path does not contain any graphic violence or sexuality, it does allude to these themes. The overall melancholy mood of the game and the potentially unsettling course of events, make The Path unsuitable for children . Despite of its origins in fairy tales, The Path is decidedly a game for the mature mind. The game features a complete realtime 3D environment that can be explored through third person navigation. The characters in this virtual world, including the player\'s avatars, are governed by a form of artificial intelligence that gives them some autonomy. As a result, nobody knows exactly what you will encounter on your journeys. Next to the multi-layered stylized graphics, The Path features a continuous soundtrack composed by goth rock diva Jarboe (ex-Swans). In fact, there are hardly any sound effects in the game. Instead the music is continuously changing according to what is happening in the game. Like the behaviours of the characters, the music too is never exactly the same twice. For a satisfying experience, it takes about 6 hours to complete the game.'),

Help them, and they will soon begin writing their own history in the stars. Every Nugget is a unique individual with a distinct set of characteristics. Just like any other living creature, Nuggets must have access to a few vital resources in order to survive. This includes water to drink, food to eat, and recreational activities to increase their happiness and quality of life. Recreational activities may include blowing stuff up. You�ve been warned. As you spend time with the Nuggets, You will see that they behave like natural, living beings. They have their own thoughts and needs - and they even have the ability to make their own decisions at times. We want to give you a feeling that you�re interacting with a living organism, almost like you�re messing around with a rather chaotic ant farm. ORGANIC GAMEPLAY Planets in The Universim aren�t just made up of a bunch of neatly-arranged objects; everything is linked together and plays a unique role in each planet�s ecosystem. Every tree your civilization cuts down, every resource they mine and every animal they hunt will affect the world they�re living in. A lack of trees and high levels of pollution will raise the global temperature over time, while reckless hunting or fishing might cause the extinction of some species. It�s your mission to manage how the Nuggets collect and utilize resources. What mark will you leave on the ecosystems that existed millions of years before your arrival? Will you use every available resource and expand at an unprecedented pace, or will you methodically create a more sustainable way of life for your civilization? These are living, breathing worlds where everything is interconnected. We aim to provide you with an unique experience unlike any of the god games you have played before. Every decision you or your civilization makes will have consequences. NATURE AS YOU KNOW IT In The Universim, nature is just as wonderful and unpredictable as ever. Every planet comes with a few surprises that are sure to challenge your civilization. From tornadoes that consume everything in their path, to thunderous earthquakes that threaten to split your civilization in two. If you treat nature poorly, it might just show you how brutal and unforgiving it can be. Each planet you encounter will have a unique underbelly. Some planets are tranquil and filled to the brim with resources, while others are barren and dangerous. Be careful out there! Something as simple as the cycle between night and day can play an important role. Wild animal attacks are more common at night, as are frequent temperature drops. Daytime offers a little more safety from the harshness of the world. With the inclusion of a full, four-season cycle, a planet�s biomes can change drastically, making it extremely difficult for Nuggets to survive brutal winters without proper preparation ahead of time.

Please see this link for details. The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is a first-person story-driven mystery game that focuses entirely on exploration and discovery. It contains no combat or explosions of any kind. If our game leaves any scars, we hope you won�t be able to see them. You play the game as Paul Prospero, an occult-minded detective who receives a disturbing letter from Ethan Carter. Realizing the boy is in grave danger, Paul arrives at Ethan�s home of Red Creek Valley, where things turn out to be even worse than he imagined. Ethan has vanished in the wake of a brutal murder, which Paul quickly discerns might not be the only local murder worth looking into. Inspired by the weird fiction (and other tales of the macabre) from the early twentieth century, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter aims to significantly evolve immersive storytelling in games. While it features a private detective and quite a few mental challenges, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is not an especially puzzle-ridden game. Our focus is on atmosphere, mood, and the essential humanity of our characters. Still, the discoveries won�t happen on their own, or without your help. Using both Paul�s supernatural skill of being able to communicate with the dead, and your own powers of observation, you will discover the mystery behind a trail of corpses, the roots of a dark ancient force lurking in Red Creek Valley, and the fate of a missing boy. Key Features Explore and interact with the beautiful yet ominous world of Red Creek Valley , which was created with the use of revolutionary photogrammetry technology that allows for nearly photorealistic environments. Communicate with the dead and see how they died in order to gather clues that help you piece together the truth behind Ethan�s disappearance -- and the fate of his family. Experience, in non-linear fashion, a story that combines the pleasures of pulp, private eye, and horror fiction , all of it inspired by writers such as Raymond Chandler, Algernon Blackwood, Stefan Grabinski, and H. P. Lovecraft. Conduct the investigation on your own terms and at your own pace . Although there are a few scary bits in the game, players will have no need for sedatives. Our game is less about terror and more about clammy unease. '),

The game provides an experience of war seen from an entirely new angle. The pace of This War of Mine is imposed by the day and night cycle. During the day snipers outside stop you from leaving your refuge, so you need to focus on maintaining your hideout: crafting, trading and taking care of your survivors. At night, take one of your civilians on a mission to scavenge through a set of unique locations for items that will help you stay alive. Make life-and-death decisions driven by your conscience. Try to protect everybody from your shelter or sacrifice some of them for longer-term survival. During war, there are no good or bad decisions; there is only survival.

The Core and the Arm have all but exhausted the resources of a galaxy in their struggle for domination. Both sides now crippled beyond repair, the remNo description availablets of their armies continue to battle on ravaged planets, their hatred fuelled by over four thousand years of total war. This is a fight to the death. For each side, the only acceptable outcome is the complete elimination of the other. Story / Background In the distant future, the galaxy is ruled by a central body of humans and artificial intelligences called the Core (a contraction of \"Consciousness Repository\"). The Core\'s technological and economic triumphs have allowed humanity to colonize most of the Milky Way and enjoy peace and prosperity. However, the balance is broken by a technological breakthrough that allows the consciousness of a human being to be reliably transferred into a machine, thereby theoretically granting infinite life, in a process called \"patterning.\" Following a mandate imposed on humanity by the Core requiring everyone to undergo patterning as a public health measure, a rebel band is formed out of colonies from the edges of the galaxy (hence their name, the Arm), whose members refused to leave their natural bodies to join the Core\'s machines. A war lasting 4,000 years followed, with the Arm mass-producing clones as pilots for its vehicles and the Core duplicating consciousness-embedded microchips to pilot its own machines. Key information Total Annihilation (TA) is a real-time strategy (RTS) video game created by Cavedog Entertainment under the guidance of lead designer Chris Taylor. It was released on September 30, 1997, and was the first RTS game to feature 3D units and terrain. Two expansion packs were released: The Core Contingency on April 30, 1998, and Battle Tactics exactly 2 months later on June 30, 1998. When TA was released, the minimum computer requirements were a Pentium 100 MHz processor and 16 MB of RAM. Of course, these requirements were for computers in 1997; modern day machines easily exceed those recommended specifications, but it is still recommended to have a 1 GHz processor and 512 MB of RAM for the updated game engine. Game features Upon release, the original TA game boasted: Fully-articulated 3D units and buildings, with a diverse complement of unit types � for example, aircraft, amphibious tanks, infantry bots (kbots), vehicles, hovercraft, ships, submarines, unit production factories, powerful stationary defenses, and long-range weapons. A unique tracking feature allows players to follow single units, entire armies, or even projectiles across the landscape.  True 3D terrain that units can climb over, into, and around, on extra-large 3D-generated maps. TA runs comfortably in high resolutions and even on modern dual monitor setups, so players can see more of the battlefield.  Numerous world types to do battle on, such as grasslands, forests, deserts, archipelagos, open water, lava, metal, ice, crystal, acid, and even moons.  More than 150 official units and 25 official missions per side in a single player campaign. The Core Contingency expansion pack added 75 new units (including the infamous Krogoth), 50 new maps, 25 new missions, and 6 new world types. Battle Tactics added 4 new units, 6 new maps, and 100 new missions. A final patch (version 3.1c, and included here) added 6 new units, including a resurrection kbot!  Detailed and exciting campaigns that focus on their respective side\'s leaders, the Commanders. The stories of either the Core or the Arm start with an effort to defend the protagonist\'s home world and initiate a turning point in the war, followed by a series of battles on numerous planets and moons (using Galactic Gates as a form of faster-than-light transportation), before a final strike on the enemy\'s home world: either on the Arm\'s bucolic Empyrean or the Core\'s artificial Jupiter Brain world of Core Prime. Mission objectives include protecting a vital structure or area, capturing a pivotal enemy unit, or simply eliminating all enemy units. More powerful units and weapons are gradually unlocked throughout the campaigns after specific missions or events.  Single-player skirmish battles and full multiplayer support, allowing players to watch and join battles, and form allied teams to share resources, information, and units.  Highly advanced weaponry, including lasers, energy machine guns (EMGs), starburst missiles, plasma shells, lightning pulses, paralyzers, and nuclear warheads.  Variables such as gravity, tides, and wind to disrupt the effectiveness of certain weapon types or to enhance resource production.  Intelligence measures to detect or jam enemy units using radar and sonar, the ability to cloak or provide stealth shielding for units, and the means to revive destroyed units from their wreckages.  Over the years, the TA community has created literally thousands of third-party units and hundreds of maps to customize a player\'s TA experience. Numerous utilities, missions, mods, and factions have also been created to rebalance or totally convert the game; many of these units are still in competitive online and skirmish play today. Modern modifications to the game push the venerable 16-year-old TA engine to new limits with complex scripting, allowing for mass unit transporting, instant map-wide teleportation, upgradeable units, and true shields � plus much more. Don\'t forget to visit File Universe and Unit Universe to download and test the TA community\'s many maps, missions, mods, races, standalone units, utilities, and other extras!

Players have an in-game role card that explains their role\'s abilities and alignments. For an in-depth look at the abilities of each role please visit: www.blankmediagames.com/roles Game Phases Night The night phase is when most roles use their abilities. For example, Serial Killers stealthily murder people, Doctors heal people who are attacked, and Sheriffs interrogate people for suspicious activity. Day The day phase allows the Town members to discuss who they suspect of being an evil role. Once the voting phase starts a majority vote from the town will put someone on trial. Defense The defense phase is when you plead your innocence to the town. Have a convincing story or find yourself facing the gallows! Judgement During this phase the town will vote on the fate of the defendant. Players can vote guilty, innocent or abstain. If there are more guilty votes than innocent votes the defendant is sentenced to death by hanging! Customization Players are able to choose their own map (town setting), character, pet, lobby icon, death animation, house and a custom name. The other players in the game will see your selections. There are currently 10 maps, 29 characters, 20 pets, 5 death animations and 20 houses to choose from. Achievements There are currently over 220 unique achievements in the game.

EVER. SERIOUSLY. In Feb 2015, as part of the Battlecruiser twenty-five year anniversary celebration, a refresh of Universal Combat v2.0 was released for FREE for a limited time. Universal Combat which was first released in 2004, was the spiritual successor to the legendary Battlecruiser 3000AD series of games which made its debut in 1996. Then heralded as the most advanced capital ship space combat game, Battlecruiser 3000AD, the first title in the series, set the resulting standard for high-end capital ship combat games. You not only had control over a massive armed carrier in a vast universe with space and planetary bodies, you also had complete control over the carrier�s systems (weapons, navigation etc), support crafts (fighters, shuttles, vehicles) as well as an entire crew that moved around the ship doing various things (e.g. engaging in combat with intruders). When Universal Combat arrived, aside from new graphics technologies, it brought along with it a host of new features which were not present in the previous Battlecruiser titles. Such features included advanced fps controls which allowed you to not only deploy your carrier crew to planets, control them in combat etc, but it also allowed you to fight alongside them In 2007, Universal Combat Collectors Edition was released as the final title in the Battlecruiser and Universal Combat IPs. In 2009, following the 2008 release of Galactic Command Echo Squad SE which had improved space and planetary engines, we again refreshed the Universal Combat CE game with those improved engines, then later released it as Universal Combat Collector�s Edition v2.0. This ultimate space capital ship combat compendium spans over two decades and represents the evolution of hard core space combat sims. It contains all Commander scenarios from every game in the Battlecruiser and Universal Combat series: Universal Combat Special Edition (3000AD, Oct 2006) Universal Combat A World Apart (3000AD, Oct 2005) Universal Combat Gold (3000AD, Oct 2005) Universal Combat (Dreamcatcher Interactive, Feb 2004) Battlecruiser Millennium Gold (Dreamcatcher Interactive, March 2003) Battlecruiser Millennium (EB Games Exclusive, Nov 2001) Battlecruiser 3000AD v2.0 (Interplay, Dec 1998) Battlecruiser 3000AD (Take2, Sept. 1996) PRIMARY GAMEPLAY FEATURES Here is a sampling of the game features, out of hundreds of things that you can do in the game; most of which you can must make up as you go along. And this list doesn\'t contain any mention of the advanced game engine technologies, especially one of the most advanced AI systems you\'ve ever encountered in a game. Command 28 capital ships including carriers, cruisers, transports. Command 46 support crafts including fighters, shuttles and planetary vehicles. Command a crew of over 100 personnel including key personnel such a Flight Officer, Navigation Officer etc. Use fleet command & control to create a massive fleet consisting of your ships and other AI controlled ones. Direct control of various ship systems including shields, reactor, engine, cloaking, tractor beam, transporters and various advanced weapon systems. Track your ship\'s AI crew as they go about their on-board duties which include engaging hostile intruders, repairing ship systems, prepping support craft etc. Lead your marines into battle on planets using various weapons of mass destruction. Deploy an away team of (e.g. marines, engineers etc) in a shuttle, deploy them on various planetside missions; complete with advanced orders. Deploy probes to keep track of friendly regions as well as spy on hostile ones. Deploy mining drones on planets to mine for precious minerals which you can then sell for profit. Dock at various space stations and planetary bases to trade, repair, rearm - and of course engage the hostile ones along the way. Capture space stations for your alliance and use them as operational bases, including the ability to use their own fleet of support craft (cruisers, carriers, fighters etc) Play the freeform scenario and roam a large persistent galaxy . No shuttles? Don\'t want to risk being shot down? Use the transporter room to deploy your combat away team directly into hostile planets. MULTIPLAYER There is no multiplayer in this version of the game. SUPPORT There are no more updates to the base game. The final version was v2.00.03 released on 05-28-2015. You can view the 2.0 changelog for more info. Due to the game being improved upon, future updates are only released via The Lyrius Conflict DLC which uses v3.x game engine kernel.

Verdun is the first multiplayer FPS set in a realistic World War One setting, the game which started the WW1 Game series. The vicious close quarters nature of trench warfare means that skill with a bayonet can be as vital as good aim with a rifle. The game offers 5 distinct game-modes with many historically accurate features such as realistic WW1 weaponry, authentic uniforms, horrendous gore, and maps based on the real battlefields of France and Belgium. The dynamic Frontlines game mode features 64 players taking turns to go over the top and attempt to capture the opposing trench line. Verdun key features include: Experience World War One gameplay: Accurate weaponry with realistic bullet physics, skill based weapon handling, poisonous gas with a claustrophobic gas mask experience, horrendous gore effects, and ferocious artillery barrages Tactical squad-based FPS: 15 distinctive squad types representing soldiers from 5+ countries, each with distinct weapons and equipment True trench warfare: Real-time dynamic frontline with momentum based attack and counter-attack gameplay Authentic World War 1 setting: Typical WW1 music and style, historical battlefields representing the key theaters on the Western Front Challenging game modes: Team-based Frontlines, tactical Attrition, and skill-based Rifle Deathmatch, desperate survival in Squad Defense and epic 64 player Frontlines including bot support. WW1 on the Western Front The gameplay in this true WW1 battlefield experience is as immersive and gritty as it can get, with features such as optional realistic gore which portrays the true horror of the First World War and authentic weaponry including artillery and gas. Weapons need to be handled with skill - each gun handles differently and there are no floating crosshairs to aid your aim, along with realistic bullet physics to contend with. Battle your way across no man�s land to capture the next enemy trench line, before switching to defense to protect your gains in the Frontlines game mode. Keep your head down or quickly don your mask in the event of artillery strikes or gas attacks. This unforgiving war isn�t for the faint hearted! Authentic World War One Setting The WW1 Game Series currently includes Verdun and Tannenberg (set on the Eastern Front). These authentic WW1 shooters let players choose from a range of squads from across the war, as they fight for control of the ever-changing frontlines. For Verdun, we carried out extensive field research at the battlefield itself and were advised by knowledgeable historians to make sure the individual elements in Verdun are as historically accurate as it can get. Uniforms have been recreated to the tiniest detail, the weapons are modeled to exact references and the maps use realistic props and terrain layouts. Everything in the game has been tailored to recreate the grim atmosphere so typical of WW1, from the immersive interface and war torn maps to realistic sounds and voices that evoke the feeling of actually being there in the mud covered trenches, peering out over no man\'s land in search of the enemy.

Start by generating a procedural world that will be unique to you, design your own custom faction then sail forward fighting pirates, trading with towns, doing quests or simply exploring -- it\'s up to you how you want to play.  As you sail about you will find resources you can make use of, upgrades for your ship, new towns that will ask your assistance, and as you get farther out from the starting area -- various pirates that will attempt to take what\'s rightfully yours. Combat experience will let you unlock new talents and abilities to make that particular line of work easier.  As you take up consignments with towns and fulfill their production shortages, the towns will grow, offering more quests, more resources and better items. As the towns continue to grow they will offer you a choice to upgrade your ship itself. Would you prefer a fast Schooner to explore the world, or a heavy Galleon that\'s able to take up 5 consignments at once? Or perhaps a massive Ship of the Line to take the fight with the pirates to their heartlands?  As you explore the world and get farther away from your starting area, the game will become progressively more difficult -- but so will the rewards. Throughout all of this you can expect the pirates to put up a fair fight, as the AI is bound by the same rules as the player: they have sight, and must explore the map before they can know what\'s there.  Speaking of AI, build a fearsome reputation and the AI will respect you, even fear you -- avoiding you if at all possible. Some friendly AI will even choose to follow you and assist you in your own adventures.  And so, on the topic of adventures -- ready to have yours?'),

A detailed strategic layer allows you to co-ordinate the defence of the planet, using your interceptors to shoot down UFOs and researching captured artefacts to learn about your foes and unlock new combat equipment to use on your missions. Xenonauts is a spiritual successor to the classic X-Com strategy games from the 1990s. We aim to improve the graphics, add new content and streamline the interface whilst still retaining all of the key mechanics of the original games. Devoted fans should love this game, but we\'re also keen to introduce the joys of old-school grand strategy to a whole new generation of players who might not otherwise experience it! Please note that the native Mac / Linux versions of the game are still in beta, however older WINE-wrapped \"ports\" are available and known to be stable whilst development of the native ports is still ongoing. Key Features Ground Combat: Xenonauts delivers tense turn-based combat across realistic, varied and fully-destructible battlefields, against almost fifty different variants of enemy. Missions range from capturing crashed UFOs or alien bases to defending cities (or even Xenonaut facilities) against alien attack. You\'ll experience the chill of encountering a new alien for the first time and the joys of test-firing a new weapon for the first time. Deeply asymmetric combat keeps the battles interesting - after all, you\'re fighting intergalactic invaders with 1970\'s ballistic technology! Strategic Management: You will also be managing the defence of the planet, dealing with the invading alien UFOs with your customisable interceptors. You need to balance the needs of your funding nations with your own. Your funds are limited - are you going to spend them on battlefield equipment, more scientists, or expanding your coverage of the planet? Your priorities must be balanced carefully if you are to win the war. Research Tree: Xenonauts has an extensive research tree with almost a hundred projects to unlock, each with its own unique description and painted artwork. It slowly reveals the intentions and origins of the invaders, while also unlocking new battlefield equipment, aircraft and vehicles for you to use as you harness alien technology and turn it against them. Persistent Soldiers: Soldiers in Xenonauts are persistent from mission to mission, improving their stats and gaining ranks with combat experience - but their deaths are always only a single bad move away. You will grow to care about the brave men and women under your command as they slowly grow from green rookies into hardened veterans, but that only makes it more painful when their heroic tale is cruelly cut short by a burst of plasma fire... Detailed, Emergent Simulation: Xenonauts contains no scripted missions, just broad rules setting the pace of the invasion. As such, no game plays out the same twice. If you shoot a Scout UFO down over a polar area, you get a Crash Site mission where you can capture a crashed Scout UFO in an Arctic tileset. Commence a battle at night and you\'ll be fighting the mission in the darkness with reduced sight range. If your base is attacked, you fight the defence in a perfect replica of your base. A lot of time has gone into weaving the two very different halves of the game together into something that feels both natural and enjoyable. '),

Demons came in droves and forced the twin Goddesses who ruled the land to whisk their subjects away from the surface, into the safe embrace of the clouds. The demons were persistent, however, erecting a massive tower in pursuit. The battle that raged upon the ground had begun ascending for a second round up above. One day, amidst this turmoil, the Goddesses stole away into the night, vanishing from Ys altogether. And there\'s only one place they could have gone: the Devil\'s Tower.

The game is played from a first person perspective and the combat is generally up close and brutal. Experience a deep storyline set in a fantastic world. Play the role of Ghat, a man banished by his own brothers and forced to begin a desperate journey past the forbidden desert and to the end of the world. Nominated in \'Excellence in Visual Art\' at the Independent Games Festival, the original visuals, which make full use of the Source engine features, breathe new air in the fantasy game genre. The new close combat mechanics are also a deviation from traditional action in the first-person genre that will feel fresh for new and veteran players.  Engaging melee combat in first person The new melee combat system allows players to perform a variety of movements like deflect & elude combos, knockback finisher punches and punishing grab attacks. Learn new attacks as the game progresses and confronts you with more formidable foes.  Fantastic visuals powered by the Source engine Players will be immersed in a fantastic world, beautiful and disturbing at the same time. The unprecedented art style brings a fresh new approach to the first person genre. The surreal environments and characters will keep players wanting to discover more.  Survival mode challenges Jump right into the action in engaging unlockable \"tower challenges\". The player must overcome enemy waves to progress through the tower levels. The game will rate the player in different categories like speed and performance. A leaderboards system will rank you against your friends, so the challenge never ends.  Deep storyline Players will play the role of Ghat; the son of a impressive hermaphrodite creature called Father-Mother, whose children form the most powerful clan in the city of Halstedom. Ghat must escape from his family and start an incredible journey with his female companion Deadra, who will aid him in the dangerous lands of Zenozoik.  Bizarre weapons The game features an unusual arsenal of eccentric weapons that are built from scraps and junk. Hammers and clubs will be the most effective when fighting heavy characters that can only be brought down with extreme force.  The Zeno Clash Model Pack for Garry\'s Mod The pack includes 70 models with the characters and creatures to be used with the popular Source engine mod Garry\'s Mod. \"This is a great addition to the existing library of assets and we really hope the fans will enjoy the content and start developing their own Zeno Clash inspired videos, screens or machinima.\" says Andres Bordeu from ACE Team.  Zeno Clash owners can download the free DLC from the Tools tab in their Steam client.  '),

After 4 years of waiting, the sequel to the surreal first-person brawler brings more variety in combat and levels, and even more bizarre storytelling into the beguiling world of Zenozoik.  Join forces with your former foe Rimat and battle against scores of angry denizens, preventing their dastardly machinations from being realized.  Zeno Clash 2 welcomes new players to the Zeno Clash universe with a new game that will bring them into the universe and fill them in on the backstory. Returning players will delight in the connections between the new settings and the first adventure. All players will thoroughly enjoy playing a first-person brawler that provides a rarity in modern gaming: a truly unique experience.  Zeno Clash 2 has beefed up its combat engine with precision punch targeting, blocking, and high-impact hits that only make the bone-crunching, face-rattling fistcuffs more satisfying. The new \"Lock-on\" function gives players a wider range of control for dishing out the damage. New RPG mechanics will allow Ghat and Rimat to punch harder, defend better, and recruit more powerful allies to aid in their quest. Zeno Clash 2 now harnesses the full power of the Unreal III engine to bring the bizarre and beautiful world of Zenozoik to life. ACE Team\'s boundless imagination brings gamers into a universe of surreal foes, fantastic locations, and truly unique visuals that is unlike anything else you will ever play.

There\'s no inventory to manage or the need to compare two almost equal item drops, just weapon selection, and mana/health are usually the bargaining chip.  A whole arsenal of magic and alchemic weapons will be at your disposal. Wreak havoc among your enemies, but watch your mana reserves or you might regret it later!
